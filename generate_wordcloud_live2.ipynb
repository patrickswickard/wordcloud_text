      "Introduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Rabelais never written his strange and marvellous romance, no one would\n",
      "ever have imagined the possibility of its production.  It stands outside\n",
      "other things--a mixture of mad mirth and gravity, of folly and reason, of\n",
      "childishness and grandeur, of the commonplace and the out-of-the-way, of\n",
      "popular verve and polished humanism, of mother-wit and learning, of\n",
      "baseness and nobility, of personalities and broad generalization, of the\n",
      "comic and the serious, of the impossible and the familiar.  Throughout the\n",
      "whole there is such a force of life and thought, such a power of good\n",
      "sense, a kind of assurance so authoritative, that he takes rank with the\n",
      "greatest; and his peers are not many.  You may like him or not, may attack\n",
      "him or sing his praises, but you cannot ignore him.  He is of those that\n",
      "die hard.  Be as fastidious as you will; make up your mind to recognize\n",
      "only those who are, without any manner of doubt, beyond and above all\n",
      "others; however few the names you keep, Rabelais' will always remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may know his work, may know it well, and admire it more every time we\n",
      "read it.  After being amused by it, after having enjoyed it, we may return\n",
      "again to study it and to enter more fully into its meaning.  Yet there is\n",
      "no possibility of knowing his own life in the same fashion.  In spite of\n",
      "all the efforts, often successful, that have been made to throw light on\n",
      "it, to bring forward a fresh document, or some obscure mention in a\n",
      "forgotten book, to add some little fact, to fix a date more precisely, it\n",
      "remains nevertheless full of uncertainty and of gaps.  Besides, it has been\n",
      "burdened and sullied by all kinds of wearisome stories and foolish\n",
      "anecdotes, so that really there is more to weed out than to add.\n",
      "\n",
      "This injustice, at first wilful, had its rise in the sixteenth century, in\n",
      "the furious attacks of a monk of Fontevrault, Gabriel de Puy-Herbault, who\n",
      "seems to have drawn his conclusions concerning the author from the book,\n",
      "and, more especially, in the regrettable satirical epitaph of Ronsard,\n",
      "piqued, it is said, that the Guises had given him only a little pavillon in\n",
      "the Forest of Meudon, whereas the presbytery was close to the chateau.\n",
      "From that time legend has fastened on Rabelais, has completely travestied\n",
      "him, till, bit by bit, it has made of him a buffoon, a veritable clown, a\n",
      "vagrant, a glutton, and a drunkard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The likeness of his person has undergone a similar metamorphosis.  He has\n",
      "been credited with a full moon of a face, the rubicund nose of an\n",
      "incorrigible toper, and thick coarse lips always apart because always\n",
      "laughing.  The picture would have surprised his friends no less than\n",
      "himself.  There have been portraits painted of Rabelais; I have seen many\n",
      "such.  They are all of the seventeenth century, and the greater number are\n",
      "conceived in this jovial and popular style.\n",

      "fifteenth century.  And, indeed, it is in the references in his romance to\n",
      "names, persons, and places, that the most certain and valuable evidence is\n",
      "to be found of his intercourse, his patrons, his friendships, his\n",
      "sojournings, and his travels:  his own work is the best and richest mine in\n",

      "statue to his honour, a twofold homage reflecting credit both on the\n",
      "province and on the town.  But the precise facts about his birth are\n",
      "nevertheless vague.  Huet speaks of the village of Benais, near Bourgeuil,\n",
      "of whose vineyards Rabelais makes mention.  As the little vineyard of La\n",
      "Deviniere, near Chinon, and familiar to all his readers, is supposed to\n",

      "his native town; Chinon, whose praises he sang with such heartiness and\n",

      "The time he spent while a child with the Benedictine monks at Seuille is\n",
      "uncertain.  There he might have made the acquaintance of the prototype of\n",

      "which looked on it as dangerous and tending to freethought and heresy, took\n",
      "possession of him.  To it he owed the warm friendship of Pierre Amy and of\n",
      "the celebrated Guillaume Bude.  In fact, the Greek letters of the latter\n",

      "bearing on the life of Rabelais.  There we learn that, dissatisfied with\n",
      "the incomplete translation of Herodotus by Laurent Valla, Rabelais had\n",
      "retranslated into Latin the first book of the History.  That translation\n",
      "unfortunately is lost, as so many other of his scattered works.  It is\n",
      "probably in this direction that the hazard of fortune has most discoveries\n",
      "and surprises in store for the lucky searcher.  Moreover, as in this law\n",

      "them.  Is Italy without fault in this respect?  Her story-tellers in prose\n",
      "lie open to easy accusation.  Her Capitoli in verse go to incredible\n",
      "lengths; and the astonishing success of Aretino must not be forgotten, nor\n",

      "topography of Rome to Jean du Bellay (at that time Bishop of Paris) who was\n",
      "raised to the Cardinalate in 1535.  Beside these dedications we must set\n",

      "granted by Henry II. on August 6th, 1550, Cardinal de Chatillon present,\n",
      "for the third book, which was dedicated, in an eight-lined stanza, to the\n",
      "Spirit of the Queen of Navarre.  These privileges, from the praises and\n",
      "eulogies they express in terms very personal and very exceptional, are as\n",
      "important in Rabelais' life as were, in connection with other matters, the\n",
      "Apostolic Pastorals in his favour.  Of course, in these the popes had not\n",
      "to introduce his books of diversions, which, nevertheless, would have\n",

      "of the birth of the second son of Henry II., was addressed to Cardinal de\n",
      "Guise, and in 1552 the fourth book was dedicated, in a new prologue, to\n",
      "Cardinal de Chatillon, the brother of Admiral de Coligny.\n",

      "These are no unknown or insignificant personages, but the greatest lords\n",
      "and princes of the Church.  They loved and admired and protected Rabelais,\n",
      "and put no restrictions in his way.  Why should we be more fastidious and\n",
      "severe than they were?  Their high contemporary appreciation gives much\n",
      "food for thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are few translations of Rabelais in foreign tongues; and certainly\n",
      "the task is no light one, and demands more than a familiarity with ordinary\n",
      "French.  It would have been easier in Italy than anywhere else.  Italian,\n",
      "from its flexibility and its analogy to French, would have lent itself\n",
      "admirably to the purpose; the instrument was ready, but the hand was not\n",
      "forthcoming.  Neither is there any Spanish translation, a fact which can be\n",
      "more easily understood.  The Inquisition would have been a far more serious\n",
      "opponent than the Paris' Sorbonne, and no one ventured on the experiment.\n",
      "Yet Rabelais forces comparison with Cervantes, whose precursor he was in\n",
      "reality, though the two books and the two minds are very different.  They\n",
      "have only one point in common, their attack and ridicule of the romances of\n",
      "chivalry and of the wildly improbable adventures of knight-errants.  But in\n",
      "Don Quixote there is not a single detail which would suggest that Cervantes\n",
      "knew Rabelais' book or owed anything to it whatsoever, even the\n",
      "starting-point of his subject.  Perhaps it was better he should not have\n",
      "been influenced by him, in however slight a degree; his originality is the\n",
      "more intact and the more genial.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Rabelais has been several times translated into German.\n",
      "In the present century Regis published at Leipsic, from 1831 to 1841, with\n",
      "copious notes, a close and faithful translation.  The first one cannot be\n",
      "so described, that of Johann Fischart, a native of Mainz or Strasburg, who\n",
      "died in 1614.  He was a Protestant controversialist, and a satirist of\n",
      "fantastic and abundant imagination.  In 1575 appeared his translation of\n",
      "Rabelais' first book, and in 1590 he published the comic catalogue of the\n",
      "library of Saint Victor, borrowed from the second book.  It is not a\n",
      "translation, but a recast in the boldest style, full of alterations and of\n",
      "exaggerations, both as regards the coarse expressions which he took upon\n",
      "himself to develop and to add to, and in the attacks on the Roman Catholic\n",
      "Church.  According to Jean Paul Richter, Fischart is much superior to\n",
      "Rabelais in style and in the fruitfulness of his ideas, and his equal in\n",
      "erudition and in the invention of new expressions after the manner of\n",
      "Aristophanes.  He is sure that his work was successful, because it was\n",
      "often reprinted during his lifetime; but this enthusiasm of Jean Paul would\n",
      "hardly carry conviction in France.  Who treads in another's footprints must\n",
      "follow in the rear.  Instead of a creator, he is but an imitator.  Those\n",
      "who take the ideas of others to modify them, and make of them creations of\n",
      "their own, like Shakespeare in England, Moliere and La Fontaine in France,\n",
      "may be superior to those who have served them with suggestions; but then\n",
      "the new works must be altogether different, must exist by themselves.\n",
      "Shakespeare and the others, when they imitated, may be said always to have\n",
      "destroyed their models.  These copyists, if we call them so, created such\n",
      "works of genius that the only pity is they are so rare.  This is not the\n",
      "case with Fischart, but it would be none the less curious were some one\n",
      "thoroughly familiar with German to translate Fischart for us, or at least,\n",
      "by long extracts from him, give an idea of the vagaries of German taste\n",
      "when it thought it could do better than Rabelais.  It is dangerous to\n",
      "tamper with so great a work, and he who does so runs a great risk of\n",
      "burning his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "England has been less daring, and her modesty and discretion have brought\n",
      "her success.  But, before speaking of Urquhart's translation, it is but\n",
      "right to mention the English-French Dictionary of Randle Cotgrave, the\n",
      "first edition of which dates from 1611.  It is in every way exceedingly\n",
      "valuable, and superior to that of Nicot, because instead of keeping to the\n",
      "plane of classic and Latin French, it showed an acquaintance with and\n",
      "mastery of the popular tongue as well as of the written and learned\n",
      "language.  As a foreigner, Cotgrave is a little behind in his information.\n",
      "He is not aware of all the changes and novelties of the passing fashion.\n",
      "The Pleiad School he evidently knew nothing of, but kept to the writers of\n",
      "the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century.  Thus words out\n",

      "remarkable.  It would be impossible and useless to compile a glossary of\n",
      "Voltaire's words.  No French writer has used so few, and all of them are of\n",
      "the simplest.  There is not one of them that is not part of the common\n",
      "speech, or which demands a note or an explanation.  Rabelais' vocabulary,\n",
      "on the other hand, is of an astonishing variety.  Where does it all come\n",
      "from?  As a fact, he had at his command something like three languages,\n",
      "which he used in turn, or which he mixed according to the effect he wished\n",
      "to produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, of course, he had ready to his hand the whole speech of his\n",

      "appropriate him, to make of him a local author, the pride of some village,\n",
      "in order that their district might have the merit of being one of the\n",
      "causes, one of the factors of his genius.  Every neighbourhood where he\n",
      "ever lived has declared that his distinction was due to his knowledge of\n",
      "its popular speech.  But these dialect-patriots have fallen out among\n",
      "themselves.  To which dialect was he indebted?  Was it that of Touraine, or\n",
      "Berri, or Poitou, or Paris?  It is too often forgotten, in regard to French\n",
      "patois--leaving out of count the languages of the South--that the words or\n",
      "expressions that are no longer in use to-day are but a survival, a still\n",
      "living trace of the tongue and the pronunciation of other days.  Rabelais,\n",
      "more than any other writer, took advantage of the happy chances and the\n",
      "richness of the popular speech, but he wrote in French, and nothing but\n",
      "French.  That is why he remains so forcible, so lucid, and so living, more\n",
      "living even--speaking only of his style out of charity to the others--than\n",

      "It has been said that great French prose is solely the work of the\n",
      "seventeenth century.  There were nevertheless, before that, two men,\n",
      "certainly very different and even hostile, who were its initiators and its\n",
      "masters, Calvin on the one hand, on the other Rabelais.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rabelais had a wonderful knowledge of the prose and the verse of the\n",
      "fifteenth century:  he was familiar with Villon, Pathelin, the Quinze Joies\n",
      "de Mariage, the Cent Nouvelles, the chronicles and the romances, and even\n",
      "earlier works, too, such as the Roman de la Rose.  Their words, their turns\n",
      "of expression came naturally to his pen, and added a piquancy and, as it\n",
      "were, a kind of gloss of antique novelty to his work.  He fabricated words,\n",
      "too, on Greek and Latin models, with great ease, sometimes audaciously and\n",
      "with needless frequency.  These were for him so many means, so many\n",
      "elements of variety.  Sometimes he did this in mockery, as in the humorous\n",
      "discourse of the Limousin scholar, for which he is not a little indebted to\n",
      "Geoffroy Tory in the Champfleury; sometimes, on the contrary, seriously,\n",
      "from a habit acquired in dealing with classical tongues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, another reason of the richness of his vocabulary was that he\n",
      "invented and forged words for himself.  Following the example of\n",
      "Aristophanes, he coined an enormous number of interminable words, droll\n",
      "expressions, sudden and surprising constructions.  What had made Greece and\n",
      "the Athenians laugh was worth transporting to Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "With an instrument so rich, resources so endless, and the skill to use\n",
      "them, it is no wonder that he could give voice to anything, be as humorous\n",
      "as he could be serious, as comic as he could be grave, that he could\n",
      "express himself and everybody else, from the lowest to the highest.  He had\n",
      "every colour on his palette, and such skill was in his fingers that he\n",
      "could depict every variety of light and shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have evidence that Rabelais did not always write in the same fashion.\n",
      "The Chronique Gargantuaine is uniform in style and quite simple, but cannot\n",
      "with certainty be attributed to him.  His letters are bombastic and thin;\n",
      "his few attempts at verse are heavy, lumbering, and obscure, altogether\n",
      "lacking in harmony, and quite as bad as those of his friend, Jean Bouchet.\n",
      "He had no gift of poetic form, as indeed is evident even from his prose.\n",
      "And his letters from Rome to the Bishop of Maillezais, interesting as they\n",
      "are in regard to the matter, are as dull, bare, flat, and dry in style as\n",
      "possible.  Without his signature no one would possibly have thought of\n",
      "attributing them to him.  He is only a literary artist when he wishes to be\n",
      "such; and in his romance he changes the style completely every other\n",
      "moment:  it has no constant character or uniform manner, and therefore\n",
      "unity is almost entirely wanting in his work, while his endeavours after\n",
      "contrast are unceasing.  There is throughout the whole the evidence of\n",
      "careful and conscious elaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, however lucid and free be the style of his romance, and though its\n",
      "flexibility and ease seem at first sight to have cost no trouble at all,\n",
      "yet its merit lies precisely in the fact that it succeeds in concealing the\n",
      "toil, in hiding the seams.  He could not have reached this perfection at a\n",
      "first attempt.  He must have worked long at the task, revised it again and\n",
      "again, corrected much, and added rather than cut away.  The aptness of form\n",
      "and expression has been arrived at by deliberate means, and owes nothing to\n",
      "chance.  Apart from the toning down of certain bold passages, to soften\n",
      "their effect, and appease the storm--for these were not literary\n",
      "alterations, but were imposed on him by prudence--one can see how numerous\n",
      "are the variations in his text, how necessary it is to take account of\n",
      "them, and to collect them.  A good edition, of course, would make no\n",
      "attempt at amalgamating these.  That would give a false impression and end\n",
      "in confusion; but it should note them all, and show them all, not combined,\n",
      "but simply as variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Le Duchat, all the editions, in their care that nothing should be\n",
      "lost, made the mistake of collecting and placing side by side things which\n",
      "had no connection with each other, which had even been substituted for each\n",
      "other.  The result was a fabricated text, full of contradictions naturally.\n",
      "But since the edition issued by M. Jannet, the well-known publisher of the\n",
      "Bibliotheque Elzevirienne, who was the first to get rid of this patchwork,\n",
      "this mosaic, Rabelais' latest text has been given, accompanied by all the\n",
      "earlier variations, to show the changes he made, as well as his\n",
      "suppressions and additions.  It would also be possible to reverse the\n",
      "method.  It would be interesting to take his first text as the basis,\n",
      "noting the later modifications.  This would be quite as instructive and\n",
      "really worth doing.  Perhaps one might then see more clearly with what care\n",
      "he made his revisions, after what fashion he corrected, and especially what\n",
      "were the additions he made.\n",
      "\n",
      "No more striking instance can be quoted than the admirable chapter about\n",
      "the shipwreck.  It was not always so long as Rabelais made it in the end:\n",
      "it was much shorter at first.  As a rule, when an author recasts some\n",
      "passage that he wishes to revise, he does so by rewriting the whole, or at\n",
      "least by interpolating passages at one stroke, so to speak.  Nothing of the\n",
      "kind is seen here.  Rabelais suppressed nothing, modified nothing; he did\n",
      "not change his plan at all.  What he did was to make insertions, to slip in\n",
      "between two clauses a new one.  He expressed his meaning in a lengthier\n",
      "way, and the former clause is found in its integrity along with the\n",
      "additional one, of which it forms, as it were, the warp.  It was by this\n",
      "method of touching up the smallest details, by making here and there such\n",
      "little noticeable additions, that he succeeded in heightening the effect\n",
      "without either change or loss.  In the end it looks as if he had altered\n",
      "nothing, added nothing new, as if it had always been so from the first, and\n",
      "had never been meddled with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comparison is most instructive, showing us to what an extent Rabelais'\n",
      "admirable style was due to conscious effort, care, and elaboration, a fact\n",
      "which is generally too much overlooked, and how instead of leaving any\n",
      "trace which would reveal toil and study, it has on the contrary a\n",
      "marvellous cohesion, precision, and brilliancy.  It was modelled and\n",
      "remodelled, repaired, touched up, and yet it has all the appearance of\n",
      "having been created at a single stroke, or of having been run like molten\n",
      "wax into its final form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something should be said here of the sources from which Rabelais borrowed.\n",
      "He was not the first in France to satirize the romances of chivalry.  The\n",
      "romance in verse by Baudouin de Sebourc, printed in recent years, was a\n",
      "parody of the Chansons de Geste.  In the Moniage Guillaume, and especially\n",
      "in the Moniage Rainouart, in which there is a kind of giant, and\n",
      "occasionally a comic giant, there are situations and scenes which remind us\n",
      "of Rabelais.  The kind of Fabliaux in mono-rhyme quatrains of the old\n",
      "Aubery anticipate his coarse and popular jests.  But all that is beside the\n",
      "question; Rabelais did not know these.  Nothing is of direct interest save\n",
      "what was known to him, what fell under his eyes, what lay to his hand--as\n",
      "the Facetiae of Poggio, and the last sermonnaires.  In the course of one's\n",
      "reading one may often enough come across the origin of some of Rabelais'\n",
      "witticisms; here and there we may discover how he has developed a\n",
      "situation.  While gathering his materials wherever he could find them, he\n",
      "was nevertheless profoundly original.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this point much research and investigation might be employed.  But there\n",
      "is no need why these researches should be extended to the region of fancy.\n",
      "Gargantua has been proved by some to be of Celtic origin.  Very often he is\n",
      "a solar myth, and the statement that Rabelais only collected popular\n",
      "traditions and gave new life to ancient legends is said to be proved by the\n",
      "large number of megalithic monuments to which is attached the name of\n",
      "Gargantua.  It was, of course, quite right to make a list of these, to draw\n",
      "up, as it were, a chart of them, but the conclusion is not justified.  The\n",
      "name, instead of being earlier, is really later, and is a witness, not to\n",
      "the origin, but to the success and rapid popularity of his novel.  No one\n",
      "has ever yet produced a written passage or any ancient testimony to prove\n",
      "the existence of the name before Rabelais.  To place such a tradition on a\n",
      "sure basis, positive traces must be forthcoming; and they cannot be adduced\n",
      "even for the most celebrated of these monuments, since he mentions himself\n",
      "the great menhir near Poitiers, which he christened by the name of\n",
      "Passelourdin.  That there is something in the theory is possible.  Perrault\n",
      "found the subjects of his stories in the tales told by mothers and nurses.\n",
      "He fixed them finally by writing them down.  Floating about vaguely as they\n",
      "were, he seized them, worked them up, gave them shape, and yet of scarcely\n",

      "that the first sixteen chapters of the fifth book published by themselves\n",
      "nine years after his death, in 1562, represent the remainder of his\n",

      "the only ones where no other hand could possibly have interfered.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the remainder the sentiment is distinctly Protestant.  Rabelais was much\n",
      "struck by the vices of the clergy and did not spare them.  Whether we are\n",
      "unable to forgive his criticisms because they were conceived in a spirit of\n",
      "raillery, or whether, on the other hand, we feel admiration for him on this\n",
      "point, yet Rabelais was not in the least a sectary.  If he strongly desired\n",
      "a moral reform, indirectly pointing out the need of it in his mocking\n",
      "fashion, he was not favourable to a political reform.  Those who would make\n",
      "of him a Protestant altogether forget that the Protestants of his time were\n",
      "not for him, but against him.  Henri Estienne, for instance, Ramus,\n",
      "Theodore de Beze, and especially Calvin, should know how he was to be\n",
      "regarded.  Rabelais belonged to what may be called the early reformation,\n",
      "to that band of honest men in the beginning of the sixteenth century,\n",
      "precursors of the later one perhaps, but, like Erasmus, between the two\n",
      "extremes.  He was neither Lutheran nor Calvinist, neither German nor\n",
      "Genevese, and it is quite natural that his work was not reprinted in\n",
      "Switzerland, which would certainly have happened had the Protestants looked\n",
      "on him as one of themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Rabelais collected the materials for the fifth book, had begun it, and\n",
      "got on some way, there can be no doubt:  the excellence of a large number\n",
      "of passages prove it, but--taken as a whole--the fifth book has not the\n",
      "value, the verve, and the variety of the others.  The style is quite\n",
      "different, less rich, briefer, less elaborate, drier, in parts even\n",
      "wearisome.  In the first four books Rabelais seldom repeats himself.  The\n",
      "fifth book contains from the point of view of the vocabulary really the\n",
      "least novelty.  On the contrary, it is full of words and expressions\n",
      "already met with, which is very natural in an imitation, in a copy, forced\n",
      "to keep to a similar tone, and to show by such reminders and likenesses\n",
      "that it is really by the same pen.  A very striking point is the profound\n",
      "difference in the use of anatomical terms.  In the other books they are\n",
      "most frequently used in a humorous sense, and nonsensically, with a quite\n",
      "other meaning than their own; in the fifth they are applied correctly.  It\n",
      "was necessary to include such terms to keep up the practice, but the writer\n",
      "has not thought of using them to add to the comic effect:  one cannot\n",
      "always think of everything.  Trouble has been taken, of course, to include\n",
      "enumerations, but there are much fewer fabricated and fantastic words.  In\n",
      "short, the hand of the maker is far from showing the same suppleness and\n",
      "strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "A eulogistic quatrain is signed Nature quite, which, it is generally\n",
      "agreed, is an anagram of Jean Turquet.  Did the adapter of the fifth book\n",
      "sign his work in this indirect fashion?  He might be of the Genevese family\n",
      "to whom Louis Turquet and his son Theodore belonged, both well-known, and\n",
      "both strong Protestants.  The obscurity relating to this matter is far from\n",
      "being cleared up, and perhaps never will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "It fell to my lot--here, unfortunately, I am forced to speak of a personal\n",
      "matter--to print for the first time the manuscript of the fifth book.  At\n",
      "first it was hoped it might be in Rabelais' own hand; afterwards that it\n",
      "might be at least a copy of his unfinished work.  The task was a difficult\n",
      "one, for the writing, extremely flowing and rapid, is execrable, and most\n",
      "difficult to decipher and to transcribe accurately.  Besides, it often\n",
      "happens in the sixteenth and the end of the fifteenth century, that\n",
      "manuscripts are much less correct than the printed versions, even when they\n",
      "have not been copied by clumsy and ignorant hands.  In this case, it is the\n",
      "writing of a clerk executed as quickly as possible.  The farther it goes\n",
      "the more incorrect it becomes, as if the writer were in haste to finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is really the origin of it?  It has less the appearance of notes or\n",
      "fragments prepared by Rabelais than of a first attempt at revision.  It is\n",
      "not an author's rough draft; still less is it his manuscript.  If I had not\n",
      "printed this enigmatical text with scrupulous and painful fidelity, I would\n",
      "do it now.  It was necessary to do it so as to clear the way.  But as the\n",
      "thing is done, and accessible to those who may be interested, and who wish\n",
      "to critically examine it, there is no further need of reprinting it.  All\n",
      "the editions of Rabelais continue, and rightly, to reproduce the edition of\n",
      "1564.  It is not the real Rabelais, but however open to criticism it may\n",
      "be, it was under that form that the fifth book appeared in the sixteenth\n",
      "century, under that form it was accepted.  Consequently it is convenient\n",
      "and even necessary to follow and keep to the original edition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first sixteen chapters may, and really must be, the text of Rabelais,\n",
      "in the final form as left by him, and found after his death; the framework,\n",
      "and a number of the passages in the continuation, the best ones, of course,\n",
      "are his, but have been patched up and tampered with.  Nothing can have been\n",
      "suppressed of what existed; it was evidently thought that everything should\n",
      "be admitted with the final revision; but the tone was changed, additions\n",
      "were made, and 'improvements.'  Adapters are always strangely vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the seventeenth century, the French printing-press, save for an edition\n",
      "issued at Troyes in 1613, gave up publishing Rabelais, and the work passed\n",

      "excellent.  They are pretty volumes to the eye, but, as in all the reprints\n",

      "critical editions.  It takes account of differences in the texts, and\n",
      "begins to point out the variations.  His very numerous notes are\n",
      "remarkable, and are still worthy of most serious consideration.  He was the\n",
      "first to offer useful elucidations, and these have been repeated after him,\n",
      "and with good reason will continue to be so.  The Abbe de Massy's edition\n",
      "of 1752, also an Amsterdam production, has made use of Le Duchat's but does\n",
      "not take its place.  Finally, at the end of the century, Cazin printed\n",

      "Freemeal (Francrepas.) and the Earl of Wetgullet (Mouillevent.).  The house\n",
      "truly for so many guests at once was somewhat narrow, but especially the\n",

      "to know if there were any other empty stable in the house, came to\n",
      "Gargantua, a little young lad, and secretly asked him where the stables of\n",

      "lead us?  To the stable, said he, of my great horses.  We are almost come\n",
      "to it; we have but these stairs to go up at.  Then leading them alongst\n",
      "another great hall, he brought them into his chamber, and, opening the\n",
      "door, said unto them, This is the stable you ask for; this is my jennet;\n",
      "this is my gelding; this is my courser, and this is my hackney, and laid on\n",
      "them with a great lever.  I will bestow upon you, said he, this Friesland\n",

      "pretty little nag, and will go very well, with a tessel of goshawks, half a\n",
      "dozen of spaniels, and a brace of greyhounds:  thus are you king of the\n",

      "whether they had most cause, either to hide their heads for shame, or to\n",
      "laugh at the jest.  As they were going down again thus amazed, he asked\n",
      "them, Will you have a whimwham (Aubeliere.)?  What is that, said they?  It\n",
      "is, said he, five turds to make you a muzzle.  To-day, said the steward,\n",
      "though we happen to be roasted, we shall not be burnt, for we are pretty\n",
      "well quipped and larded, in my opinion.  O my jolly dapper boy, thou hast\n",
      "given us a gudgeon; I hope to see thee Pope before I die.  I think so, said\n",
      "he, myself; and then shall you be a puppy, and this gentle popinjay a\n",
      "perfect papelard, that is, dissembler.  Well, well, said the harbinger.\n",
      "But, said Gargantua, guess how many stitches there are in my mother's\n",
      "smock.  Sixteen, quoth the harbinger.  You do not speak gospel, said\n",
      "Gargantua, for there is cent before, and cent behind, and you did not\n",
      "reckon them ill, considering the two under holes.  When? said the\n",
      "harbinger.  Even then, said Gargantua, when they made a shovel of your nose\n",
      "to take up a quarter of dirt, and of your throat a funnel, wherewith to put\n",
      "it into another vessel, because the bottom of the old one was out.\n",
      "Cocksbod, said the steward, we have met with a prater.  Farewell, master\n",
      "tattler, God keep you, so goodly are the words which you come out with, and\n",
      "so fresh in your mouth, that it had need to be salted.\n",

      "leagues long, and seventeen in breadth, or thereabouts.  This forest was\n",
      "most horribly fertile and copious in dorflies, hornets, and wasps, so that\n",
      "it was a very purgatory for the poor mares, asses, and horses.  But\n",
      "Gargantua's mare did avenge herself handsomely of all the outrages therein\n",
      "committed upon beasts of her kind, and that by a trick whereof they had no\n",

      "and sidewise, over and under, and felled everywhere the wood with as much\n",

      "shall draw a greater confluence of people together than an evangelical\n",

      "drowned two hundred and sixty thousand, four hundred and eighteen, besides\n",

      "there swore everyone by the Sancts of his parish, the Parisians, which are\n",
      "patched up of all nations and all pieces of countries, are by nature both\n",

      "called Parisians from the Greek word parresia, which signifies boldness and\n",

      "that nature cannot endure a sudden change, without great violence.\n",

      "of that time, called Master Theodorus, seriously to perpend, if it were\n",
      "possible, how to bring Gargantua into a better course.  The said physician\n",
      "purged him canonically with Anticyrian hellebore, by which medicine he\n",
      "cleansed all the alteration and perverse habitude of his brain.  By this\n",
      "means also Ponocrates made him forget all that he had learned under his\n",
      "ancient preceptors, as Timotheus did to his disciples, who had been\n",
      "instructed under other musicians.  To do this the better, they brought him\n",
      "into the company of learned men, which were there, in whose imitation he\n",
      "had a great desire and affection to study otherwise, and to improve his\n",
      "parts.  Afterwards he put himself into such a road and way of studying,\n",
      "that he lost not any one hour in the day, but employed all his time in\n",
      "learning and honest knowledge.  Gargantua awaked, then, about four o'clock\n",
      "in the morning.  Whilst they were in rubbing of him, there was read unto\n",
      "him some chapter of the holy Scripture aloud and clearly, with a\n",
      "pronunciation fit for the matter, and hereunto was appointed a young page\n",
      "born in Basche, named Anagnostes.  According to the purpose and argument of\n",
      "that lesson, he oftentimes gave himself to worship, adore, pray, and send\n",
      "up his supplications to that good God, whose Word did show his majesty and\n",
      "marvellous judgment.  Then went he unto the secret places to make excretion\n",
      "of his natural digestions.  There his master repeated what had been read,\n",
      "expounding unto him the most obscure and difficult points.  In returning,\n",
      "they considered the face of the sky, if it was such as they had observed it\n",
      "the night before, and into what signs the sun was entering, as also the\n",
      "moon for that day.  This done, he was apparelled, combed, curled, trimmed,\n",
      "and perfumed, during which time they repeated to him the lessons of the day\n",
      "before.  He himself said them by heart, and upon them would ground some\n",
      "practical cases concerning the estate of man, which he would prosecute\n",
      "sometimes two or three hours, but ordinarily they ceased as soon as he was\n",

      "a ring, to pass it), most gallantly exercising their bodies, as formerly\n",
      "they had done their minds.  All their play was but in liberty, for they\n",
      "left off when they pleased, and that was commonly when they did sweat over\n",
      "all their body, or were otherwise weary.  Then were they very well wiped\n",
      "and rubbed, shifted their shirts, and, walking soberly, went to see if\n",
      "dinner was ready.  Whilst they stayed for that, they did clearly and\n",
      "eloquently pronounce some sentences that they had retained of the lecture.\n",
      "In the meantime Master Appetite came, and then very orderly sat they down\n",
      "at table.  At the beginning of the meal there was read some pleasant\n",
      "history of the warlike actions of former times, until he had taken a glass\n",
      "of wine.  Then, if they thought good, they continued reading, or began to\n",
      "discourse merrily together; speaking first of the virtue, propriety,\n",
      "efficacy, and nature of all that was served in at the table; of bread, of\n",
      "wine, of water, of salt, of fleshes, fishes, fruits, herbs, roots, and of\n",
      "their dressing.  By means whereof he learned in a little time all the\n",
      "passages competent for this that were to be found in Pliny, Athenaeus,\n",
      "Dioscorides, Julius Pollux, Galen, Porphyry, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodore,\n",
      "Aristotle, Aelian, and others.  Whilst they talked of these things, many\n",
      "times, to be the more certain, they caused the very books to be brought to\n",
      "the table, and so well and perfectly did he in his memory retain the things\n",
      "above said, that in that time there was not a physician that knew half so\n",
      "much as he did.  Afterwards they conferred of the lessons read in the\n",
      "morning, and, ending their repast with some conserve or marmalade of\n",
      "quinces, he picked his teeth with mastic tooth-pickers, washed his hands\n",
      "and eyes with fair fresh water, and gave thanks unto God in some fine\n",
      "cantiques, made in praise of the divine bounty and munificence.  This done,\n",
      "they brought in cards, not to play, but to learn a thousand pretty tricks\n",
      "and new inventions, which were all grounded upon arithmetic.  By this means\n",
      "he fell in love with that numerical science, and every day after dinner and\n",
      "supper he passed his time in it as pleasantly as he was wont to do at cards\n",
      "and dice; so that at last he understood so well both the theory and\n",
      "practical part thereof, that Tunstall the Englishman, who had written very\n",
      "largely of that purpose, confessed that verily in comparison of him he had\n",
      "no skill at all.  And not only in that, but in the other mathematical\n",
      "sciences, as geometry, astronomy, music, &c.  For in waiting on the\n",
      "concoction and attending the digestion of his food, they made a thousand\n",
      "pretty instruments and geometrical figures, and did in some measure\n",
      "practise the astronomical canons.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this they recreated themselves with singing musically, in four or\n",
      "five parts, or upon a set theme or ground at random, as it best pleased\n",
      "them.  In matter of musical instruments, he learned to play upon the lute,\n",
      "the virginals, the harp, the Almain flute with nine holes, the viol, and\n",
      "the sackbut.  This hour thus spent, and digestion finished, he did purge\n",
      "his body of natural excrements, then betook himself to his principal study\n",
      "for three hours together, or more, as well to repeat his matutinal lectures\n",
      "as to proceed in the book wherein he was, as also to write handsomely, to\n",
      "draw and form the antique and Roman letters.  This being done, they went\n",
      "out of their house, and with them a young gentleman of Touraine, named the\n",
      "Esquire Gymnast, who taught him the art of riding.  Changing then his\n",
      "clothes, he rode a Naples courser, a Dutch roussin, a Spanish jennet, a\n",
      "barded or trapped steed, then a light fleet horse, unto whom he gave a\n",
      "hundred carieres, made him go the high saults, bounding in the air, free\n",
      "the ditch with a skip, leap over a stile or pale, turn short in a ring both\n",
      "to the right and left hand.  There he broke not his lance; for it is the\n",
      "greatest foolery in the world to say, I have broken ten lances at tilts or\n",
      "in fight.  A carpenter can do even as much.  But it is a glorious and\n",
      "praise-worthy action with one lance to break and overthrow ten enemies.\n",
      "Therefore, with a sharp, stiff, strong, and well-steeled lance would he\n",
      "usually force up a door, pierce a harness, beat down a tree, carry away the\n",
      "ring, lift up a cuirassier saddle, with the mail-coat and gauntlet.  All\n",
      "this he did in complete arms from head to foot.  As for the prancing\n",
      "flourishes and smacking popisms for the better cherishing of the horse,\n",
      "commonly used in riding, none did them better than he.  The cavallerize of\n",
      "Ferrara was but as an ape compared to him.  He was singularly skilful in\n",
      "leaping nimbly from one horse to another without putting foot to ground,\n",
      "and these horses were called desultories.  He could likewise from either\n",
      "side, with a lance in his hand, leap on horseback without stirrups, and\n",
      "rule the horse at his pleasure without a bridle, for such things are useful\n",
      "in military engagements.  Another day he exercised the battle-axe, which he\n",
      "so dexterously wielded, both in the nimble, strong, and smooth management\n",
      "of that weapon, and that in all the feats practicable by it, that he passed\n",
      "knight of arms in the field, and at all essays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then tossed he the pike, played with the two-handed sword, with the\n",
      "backsword, with the Spanish tuck, the dagger, poniard, armed, unarmed, with\n",
      "a buckler, with a cloak, with a target.  Then would he hunt the hart, the\n",
      "roebuck, the bear, the fallow deer, the wild boar, the hare, the pheasant,\n",
      "the partridge, and the bustard.  He played at the balloon, and made it\n",
      "bound in the air, both with fist and foot.  He wrestled, ran, jumped--not\n",
      "at three steps and a leap, called the hops, nor at clochepied, called the\n",
      "hare's leap, nor yet at the Almains; for, said Gymnast, these jumps are for\n",
      "the wars altogether unprofitable, and of no use--but at one leap he would\n",
      "skip over a ditch, spring over a hedge, mount six paces upon a wall, ramp\n",
      "and grapple after this fashion up against a window of the full height of a\n",
      "lance.  He did swim in deep waters on his belly, on his back, sideways,\n",
      "with all his body, with his feet only, with one hand in the air, wherein he\n",
      "held a book, crossing thus the breadth of the river of Seine without\n",
      "wetting it, and dragged along his cloak with his teeth, as did Julius\n",
      "Caesar; then with the help of one hand he entered forcibly into a boat,\n",
      "from whence he cast himself again headlong into the water, sounded the\n",
      "depths, hollowed the rocks, and plunged into the pits and gulfs.  Then\n",
      "turned he the boat about, governed it, led it swiftly or slowly with the\n",
      "stream and against the stream, stopped it in his course, guided it with one\n",
      "hand, and with the other laid hard about him with a huge great oar, hoisted\n",
      "the sail, hied up along the mast by the shrouds, ran upon the edge of the\n",
      "decks, set the compass in order, tackled the bowlines, and steered the\n",
      "helm.  Coming out of the water, he ran furiously up against a hill, and\n",
      "with the same alacrity and swiftness ran down again.  He climbed up at\n",
      "trees like a cat, and leaped from the one to the other like a squirrel.  He\n",
      "did pull down the great boughs and branches like another Milo; then with\n",
      "two sharp well-steeled daggers and two tried bodkins would he run up by the\n",
      "wall to the very top of a house like a rat; then suddenly came down from\n",
      "the top to the bottom, with such an even composition of members that by the\n",
      "fall he would catch no harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did cast the dart, throw the bar, put the stone, practise the javelin,\n",
      "the boar-spear or partisan, and the halbert.  He broke the strongest bows\n",
      "in drawing, bended against his breast the greatest crossbows of steel, took\n",
      "his aim by the eye with the hand-gun, and shot well, traversed and planted\n",
      "the cannon, shot at butt-marks, at the papgay from below upwards, or to a\n",
      "height from above downwards, or to a descent; then before him, sideways,\n",
      "and behind him, like the Parthians.  They tied a cable-rope to the top of a\n",
      "high tower, by one end whereof hanging near the ground he wrought himself\n",
      "with his hands to the very top; then upon the same track came down so\n",
      "sturdily and firm that you could not on a plain meadow have run with more\n",
      "assurance.  They set up a great pole fixed upon two trees.  There would he\n",
      "hang by his hands, and with them alone, his feet touching at nothing, would\n",
      "go back and fore along the foresaid rope with so great swiftness that\n",
      "hardly could one overtake him with running; and then, to exercise his\n",
      "breast and lungs, he would shout like all the devils in hell.  I heard him\n",
      "once call Eudemon from St. Victor's gate to Montmartre.  Stentor had never\n",
      "such a voice at the siege of Troy.  Then for the strengthening of his\n",
      "nerves or sinews they made him two great sows of lead, each of them\n",
      "weighing eight thousand and seven hundred quintals, which they called\n",
      "alteres.  Those he took up from the ground, in each hand one, then lifted\n",
      "them up over his head, and held them so without stirring three quarters of\n",
      "an hour and more, which was an inimitable force.  He fought at barriers\n",
      "with the stoutest and most vigorous champions; and when it came to the\n",
      "cope, he stood so sturdily on his feet that he abandoned himself unto the\n",
      "strongest, in case they could remove him from his place, as Milo was wont\n",
      "to do of old.  In whose imitation, likewise, he held a pomegranate in his\n",
      "hand, to give it unto him that could take it from him.  The time being thus\n",
      "bestowed, and himself rubbed, cleansed, wiped, and refreshed with other\n",
      "clothes, he returned fair and softly; and passing through certain meadows,\n",
      "or other grassy places, beheld the trees and plants, comparing them with\n",
      "what is written of them in the books of the ancients, such as Theophrast,\n",
      "Dioscorides, Marinus, Pliny, Nicander, Macer, and Galen, and carried home\n",
      "to the house great handfuls of them, whereof a young page called Rizotomos\n",
      "had charge; together with little mattocks, pickaxes, grubbing-hooks,\n",
      "cabbies, pruning-knives, and other instruments requisite for herborizing.\n",
      "Being come to their lodging, whilst supper was making ready, they repeated\n",
      "certain passages of that which hath been read, and sat down to table.  Here\n",
      "remark, that his dinner was sober and thrifty, for he did then eat only to\n",
      "prevent the gnawings of his stomach, but his supper was copious and large,\n",
      "for he took then as much as was fit to maintain and nourish him; which,\n",
      "indeed, is the true diet prescribed by the art of good and sound physic,\n",
      "although a rabble of loggerheaded physicians, nuzzeled in the brabbling\n",
      "shop of sophisters, counsel the contrary.  During that repast was continued\n",
      "the lesson read at dinner as long as they thought good; the rest was spent\n",
      "in good discourse, learned and profitable.  After that they had given\n",
      "thanks, he set himself to sing vocally, and play upon harmonious\n",
      "instruments, or otherwise passed his time at some pretty sports, made with\n",
      "cards or dice, or in practising the feats of legerdemain with cups and\n",
      "balls.  There they stayed some nights in frolicking thus, and making\n",
      "themselves merry till it was time to go to bed; and on other nights they\n",
      "would go make visits unto learned men, or to such as had been travellers in\n",
      "strange and remote countries.  When it was full night before they retired\n",
      "themselves, they went unto the most open place of the house to see the face\n",
      "of the sky, and there beheld the comets, if any were, as likewise the\n",

      "up of hay, in cleaving and sawing of wood, and in threshing sheaves of corn\n",
      "at the barn.  Then they studied the art of painting or carving; or brought\n",

      "also to hear the public lectures, the solemn commencements, the\n",
      "repetitions, the acclamations, the pleadings of the gentle lawyers, and\n",
      "sermons of evangelical preachers.  He went through the halls and places\n",
      "appointed for fencing, and there played against the masters themselves at\n",
      "all weapons, and showed them by experience that he knew as much in it as,\n",
      "yea, more than, they.  And, instead of herborizing, they visited the shops\n",

      "formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us\n",

      "do we serve you thus when you come hither to buy our good corn, whereof you\n",

      "it, and possibly have need of us at another time, when we shall use you\n",
      "after the like manner, and therefore remember it.  Then Marquet, a prime\n",
      "man in the confraternity of the cake-bakers, said unto him, Yea, sir, thou\n",

      "went towards him, and drew a sixpence out of his leather satchel, thinking\n",
      "that Marquet would have sold him some of his cakes.  But, instead of cakes,\n",

      "head, upon the crotaphic artery of the right side thereof, so forcibly,\n",
      "that Marquet fell down from his mare more like a dead than living man.\n",

      "found by true information that his men had taken violently some cakes from\n",
      "Picrochole's people, and that Marquet's head was broken with a slacky or\n",
      "short cudgel; that, nevertheless, all was well paid, and that the said\n",
      "Marquet had first hurt Forgier with a stroke of his whip athwart the legs.\n",
      "And it seemed good to his whole council, that he should defend himself with\n",
      "all his might.  Notwithstanding all this, said Grangousier, seeing the\n",
      "question is but about a few cakes, I will labour to content him; for I am\n",
      "very unwilling to wage war against him.  He inquired then what quantity of\n",
      "cakes they had taken away, and understanding that it was but some four or\n",
      "five dozen, he commanded five cartloads of them to be baked that same\n",
      "night; and that there should be one full of cakes made with fine butter,\n",
      "fine yolks of eggs, fine saffron, and fine spice, to be bestowed upon\n",

      "wherewith all the carriers were enjoined to garnish and deck their carts,\n",
      "and each of them to carry one in his hand, as himself likewise did, thereby\n",

      "into your own country from within this place, unto which you have no right\n",
      "at all, as yourselves must needs confess, and let us be good friends as\n",

      "too soon.  We shall have, said Picrochole, but too much sustenance and\n",
      "feeding-stuff.  Came we hither to eat or to fight?  To fight, indeed, said\n",

      "force is exiled.  Leave off your prating, said Picrochole, and forthwith\n",

      "and carts, and sent them away without speaking one word, only that they\n",
      "would come no more so near, for a reason that they would give them the\n",

      "chichling peas, among the cabbages and lettuces.  Gargantua finding himself\n",
      "somewhat dry, asked whether they could get any lettuce to make him a salad;\n",
      "and hearing that there were the greatest and fairest in the country, for\n",
      "they were as great as plum-trees or as walnut-trees, he would go thither\n",
      "himself, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good, and withal\n",

      "as they were thus deliberating what to do, Gargantua put them with the\n",
      "lettuce into a platter of the house, as large as the huge tun of the White\n",
      "Friars of the Cistercian order; which done, with oil, vinegar, and salt, he\n",
      "ate them up, to refresh himself a little before supper, and had already\n",
      "swallowed up five of the pilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, totally\n",
      "hid under a lettuce, except his bourdon or staff that appeared, and nothing\n",
      "else.  Which Grangousier seeing, said to Gargantua, I think that is the\n",
      "horn of a shell-snail, do not eat it.  Why not? said Gargantua, they are\n",
      "good all this month:  which he no sooner said, but, drawing up the staff,\n",
      "and therewith taking up the pilgrim, he ate him very well, then drank a\n",
      "terrible draught of excellent white wine.  The pilgrims, thus devoured,\n",
      "made shift to save themselves as well as they could, by withdrawing their\n",
      "bodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth, but could not escape\n",
      "from thinking they had been put in the lowest dungeon of a prison.  And\n",
      "when Gargantua whiffed the great draught, they thought to have been drowned\n",
      "in his mouth, and the flood of wine had almost carried them away into the\n",
      "gulf of his stomach.  Nevertheless, skipping with their bourdons, as St.\n",
      "Michael's palmers use to do, they sheltered themselves from the danger of\n",

      "groping or sounding the country with his staff, to try whether they were in\n",
      "safety or no, struck hard against the cleft of a hollow tooth, and hit the\n",
      "mandibulary sinew or nerve of the jaw, which put Gargantua to very great\n",
      "pain, so that he began to cry for the rage that he felt.  To ease himself\n",

      "temple-bones, and lifting up in the upper part of the skull the two\n",
      "triangulary bones called sincipital, or the two bones bregmatis, together\n",

      "his bed was praying unto God for their safety and victory.  And seeing them\n",
      "all safe and sound, he embraced them lovingly, and asked what was become of\n",
      "the monk.  Gargantua answered him that without doubt the enemies had the\n",
      "monk.  Then have they mischief and ill luck, said Grangousier; which was\n",
      "very true.  Therefore is it a common proverb to this day, to give a man the\n",
      "monk, or, as in French, lui bailler le moine, when they would express the\n",
      "doing unto one a mischief.  Then commanded he a good breakfast to be\n",

      "but he was so aggrieved that the monk was not to be heard of that he would\n",
      "neither eat nor drink.  In the meanwhile the monk comes, and from the gate\n",

      "friend!  Gymnast went out and saw that it was Friar John, who brought along\n",

      "likewise went forth to meet him, and all of them made him the best welcome\n",
      "that possibly they could, and brought him before Grangousier, who asked him\n",
      "of all his adventures.  The monk told him all, both how he was taken, how\n",
      "he rid himself of his keepers, of the slaughter he had made by the way, and\n",
      "how he had rescued the pilgrims and brought along with him Captain\n",
      "Touchfaucet.  Then did they altogether fall to banqueting most merrily.  In\n",
      "the meantime Grangousier asked the pilgrims what countrymen they were,\n",
      "whence they came, and whither they went.  Sweer-to-go in the name of the\n",
      "rest answered, My sovereign lord, I am of Saint Genou in Berry, this man is\n",
      "of Palvau, this other is of Onzay, this of Argy, this of St. Nazarand, and\n",
      "this man of Villebrenin.  We come from Saint Sebastian near Nantes, and are\n",
      "now returning, as we best may, by easy journeys.  Yea, but, said\n",
      "Grangousier, what went you to do at Saint Sebastian?  We went, said\n",
      "Sweer-to-go, to offer up unto that sanct our vows against the plague.  Ah,\n",
      "poor men! said Grangousier, do you think that the plague comes from Saint\n",
      "Sebastian?  Yes, truly, answered Sweer-to-go, our preachers tell us so\n",
      "indeed.  But is it so, said Grangousier, do the false prophets teach you\n",
      "such abuses?  Do they thus blaspheme the sancts and holy men of God, as to\n",
      "make them like unto the devils, who do nothing but hurt unto mankind,--as\n",
      "Homer writeth, that the plague was sent into the camp of the Greeks by\n",
      "Apollo, and as the poets feign a great rabble of Vejoves and mischievous\n",
      "gods.  So did a certain cafard or dissembling religionary preach at Sinay,\n",
      "that Saint Anthony sent the fire into men's legs, that Saint Eutropius made\n",
      "men hydropic, Saint Clidas, fools, and that Saint Genou made them goutish.\n",
      "But I punished him so exemplarily, though he called me heretic for it, that\n",
      "since that time no such hypocritical rogue durst set his foot within my\n",
      "territories.  And truly I wonder that your king should suffer them in their\n",
      "sermons to publish such scandalous doctrine in his dominions; for they\n",
      "deserve to be chastised with greater severity than those who, by magical\n",
      "art, or any other device, have brought the pestilence into a country.  The\n",
      "pest killeth but the bodies, but such abominable imposters empoison our\n",
      "very souls.  As he spake these words, in came the monk very resolute, and\n",
      "asked them, Whence are you, you poor wretches?  Of Saint Genou, said they.\n",
      "And how, said the monk, does the Abbot Gulligut, the good drinker,--and the\n",

      "return; for the very shadow of the steeple of an abbey is fruitful.  It is,\n",
      "said Gargantua, like the water of Nilus in Egypt, if you believe Strabo and\n",
      "Pliny, Lib. 7, cap. 3.  What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in\n",

      "refection; but the pilgrims did nothing but sigh, and said to Gargantua, O\n",
      "how happy is that land which hath such a man for their lord!  We have been\n",
      "more edified and instructed by the talk which he had with us, than by all\n",
      "the sermons that ever were preached in our town.  This is, said Gargantua,\n",

      "Gargantua, you must not build a wall about your convent, for all other\n",
      "abbeys are strongly walled and mured about.  See, said the monk, and not\n",
      "without cause (seeing wall and mur signify but one and the same thing);\n",
      "where there is mur before and mur behind, there is store of murmur, envy,\n",
      "and mutual conspiracy.  Moreover, seeing there are certain convents in the\n",
      "world whereof the custom is, if any woman come in, I mean chaste and honest\n",
      "women, they immediately sweep the ground which they have trod upon;\n",
      "therefore was it ordained, that if any man or woman entered into religious\n",
      "orders should by chance come within this new abbey, all the rooms should be\n",
      "thoroughly washed and cleansed through which they had passed.  And because\n",
      "in all other monasteries and nunneries all is compassed, limited, and\n",
      "regulated by hours, it was decreed that in this new structure there should\n",
      "be neither clock nor dial, but that according to the opportunities and\n",
      "incident occasions all their hours should be disposed of; for, said\n",
      "Gargantua, the greatest loss of time that I know is to count the hours.\n",
      "What good comes of it?  Nor can there be any greater dotage in the world\n",
      "than for one to guide and direct his courses by the sound of a bell, and\n",
      "not by his own judgment and discretion.\n",

      "woman that is neither fair nor good, to what use serves she?  To make a nun\n",
      "of, said Gargantua.  Yea, said the monk, and to make shirts and smocks.\n",
      "Therefore was it ordained that into this religious order should be admitted\n",
      "no women that were not fair, well-featured, and of a sweet disposition; nor\n",

      "of the sun, and as many of the seven stars, to be charged all upon the\n",
      "receipt of the custom.  For the foundation and maintenance thereof for\n",
      "ever, he settled a perpetual fee-farm-rent of three-and-twenty hundred,\n",
      "three score and nine thousand, five hundred and fourteen rose nobles,\n",
      "exempted from all homage, fealty, service, or burden whatsoever, and\n",
      "payable every year at the gate of the abbey; and of this by letters patent\n",
      "passed a very good grant.  The architecture was in a figure hexagonal, and\n",
      "in such a fashion that in every one of the six corners there was built a\n",
      "great round tower of threescore foot in diameter, and were all of a like\n",
      "form and bigness.  Upon the north side ran along the river of Loire, on the\n",
      "bank whereof was situated the tower called Arctic.  Going towards the east,\n",
      "there was another called Calaer,--the next following Anatole,--the next\n",
      "Mesembrine,--the next Hesperia, and the last Criere.  Every tower was\n",
      "distant from other the space of three hundred and twelve paces.  The whole\n",
      "edifice was everywhere six storeys high, reckoning the cellars underground\n",
      "for one.  The second was arched after the fashion of a basket-handle; the\n",
      "rest were ceiled with pure wainscot, flourished with Flanders fretwork, in\n",
      "the form of the foot of a lamp, and covered above with fine slates, with an\n",
      "endorsement of lead, carrying the antique figures of little puppets and\n",
      "animals of all sorts, notably well suited to one another, and gilt,\n",
      "together with the gutters, which, jutting without the walls from betwixt\n",
      "the crossbars in a diagonal figure, painted with gold and azure, reached to\n",
      "the very ground, where they ended into great conduit-pipes, which carried\n",
      "all away unto the river from under the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This same building was a hundred times more sumptuous and magnificent than\n",
      "ever was Bonnivet, Chambourg, or Chantilly; for there were in it nine\n",
      "thousand, three hundred and two-and-thirty chambers, every one whereof had\n",
      "a withdrawing-room, a handsome closet, a wardrobe, an oratory, and neat\n",
      "passage, leading into a great and spacious hall.  Between every tower in\n",
      "the midst of the said body of building there was a pair of winding, such as\n",
      "we now call lantern stairs, whereof the steps were part of porphyry, which\n",
      "is a dark red marble spotted with white, part of Numidian stone, which is a\n",
      "kind of yellowishly-streaked marble upon various colours, and part of\n",
      "serpentine marble, with light spots on a dark green ground, each of those\n",
      "steps being two-and-twenty foot in length and three fingers thick, and the\n",
      "just number of twelve betwixt every rest, or, as we now term it,\n",
      "landing-place.  In every resting-place were two fair antique arches where\n",

      "and of the breadth of the said winding, and the reascending above the roofs\n",
      "of the house ended conically in a pavilion.  By that vise or winding they\n",
      "entered on every side into a great hall, and from the halls into the\n",
      "chambers. From the Arctic tower unto the Criere were the fair great\n",
      "libraries in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French, Italian, and Spanish,\n",
      "respectively distributed in their several cantons, according to the\n",
      "diversity of these languages.  In the midst there was a wonderful scalier or\n",
      "winding-stair, the entry whereof was without the house, in a vault or arch\n",
      "six fathom broad.  It was made in such symmetry and largeness that six\n",
      "men-at-arms with their lances in their rests might together in a breast ride\n",
      "all up to the very top of all the palace.  From the tower Anatole to the\n",
      "Mesembrine were fair spacious galleries, all coloured over and painted with\n",
      "the ancient prowesses, histories, and descriptions of the world.  In the\n",

      "to taste of their spiced bread.  Panurge was with him, having always a\n",

      "this he never went, saying that it was as a yeoman of the guard to him, to\n",
      "preserve his body from harm.  Other sword carried he none; and, when\n",
      "Pantagruel would have given him one, he answered that he needed none, for\n",
      "that it would but heat his milt.  Yea but, said Epistemon, if thou shouldst\n",
      "be set upon, how wouldst thou defend thyself?  With great buskinades or\n",
      "brodkin blows, answered he, provided thrusts were forbidden.  At their\n",
      "return, Panurge considered the walls of the city of Paris, and in derision\n",
      "said to Pantagruel, See what fair walls here are!  O how strong they are,\n",
      "and well fitted to keep geese in a mew or coop to fatten them!  By my\n",
      "beard, they are competently scurvy for such a city as this is; for a cow\n",
      "with one fart would go near to overthrow above six fathoms of them.  O my\n",
      "friend, said Pantagruel, dost thou know what Agesilaus said when he was\n",
      "asked why the great city of Lacedaemon was not enclosed with walls?  Lo\n",
      "here, said he, the walls of the city! in showing them the inhabitants and\n",
      "citizens thereof, so strong, so well armed, and so expert in military\n",

      "towns and cities cannot have a surer wall nor better fortification than the\n",
      "prowess and virtue of the citizens and inhabitants.  So is this city so\n",
      "strong, by the great number of warlike people that are in it, that they\n",
      "care not for making any other walls.  Besides, whosoever would go about to\n",
      "wall it, as Strasbourg, Orleans, or Ferrara, would find it almost\n",
      "impossible, the cost and charges would be so excessive.  Yea but, said\n",
      "Panurge, it is good, nevertheless, to have an outside of stone when we are\n",
      "invaded by our enemies, were it but to ask, Who is below there?  As for the\n",

      "you.  I see that the sine quo nons, kallibistris, or contrapunctums of the\n",
      "women of this country are better cheap than stones.  Of them should the\n",
      "walls be built, ranging them in good symmetry by the rules of architecture,\n",
      "and placing the largest in the first ranks, then sloping downwards\n",
      "ridge-wise, like the back of an ass.  The middle-sized ones must be ranked\n",

      "poor lion, walking through the forest of Bieure, and saying his own little\n",
      "private devotions, passed under a tree where there was a roguish collier\n",
      "gotten up to cut down wood, who, seeing the lion, cast his hatchet at him\n",
      "and wounded him enormously in one of his legs; whereupon the lion halting,\n",
      "he so long toiled and turmoiled himself in roaming up and down the forest\n",
      "to find help, that at last he met with a carpenter, who willingly looked\n",
      "upon his wound, cleansed it as well as he could, and filled it with moss,\n",

      "their excrements in it, whilst he should go search for some yarrow or\n",

      "old hag was picking up and gathering some sticks in the said forest, who,\n",
      "seeing the lion coming towards her, for fear fell down backwards, in such\n",
      "sort that the wind blew up her gown, coats, and smock, even as far as above\n",
      "her shoulders; which the lion perceiving, for pity ran to see whether she\n",
      "had taken any hurt by the fall, and thereupon considering her how do you\n",
      "call it, said, O poor woman, who hath thus wounded thee?  Which words when\n",
      "he had spoken, he espied a fox, whom he called to come to him saying,\n",
      "Gossip Reynard, hau, hither, hither, and for cause!  When the fox was come,\n",
      "he said unto him, My gossip and friend, they have hurt this good woman here\n",
      "between the legs most villainously, and there is a manifest solution of\n",
      "continuity.  See how great a wound it is, even from the tail up to the\n",
      "navel, in measure four, nay full five handfuls and a half.  This is the\n",
      "blow of a hatchet, I doubt me; it is an old wound, and therefore, that the\n",
      "flies may not get into it, wipe it lustily well and hard, I prithee, both\n",
      "within and without; thou hast a good tail, and long.  Wipe, my friend,\n",
      "wipe, I beseech thee, and in the meanwhile I will go get some moss to put\n",
      "into it; for thus ought we to succour and help one another.  Wipe it hard,\n",
      "thus, my friend; wipe it well, for this wound must be often wiped,\n",
      "otherwise the party cannot be at ease.  Go to, wipe well, my little gossip,\n",
      "wipe; God hath furnished thee with a tail; thou hast a long one, and of a\n",
      "bigness proportionable; wipe hard, and be not weary.  A good wiper, who, in\n",
      "wiping continually, wipeth with his wipard, by wasps shall never be\n",
      "wounded.  Wipe, my pretty minion; wipe, my little bully; I will not stay\n",
      "long.  Then went he to get store of moss; and when he was a little way off,\n",
      "he cried out in speaking to the fox thus, Wipe well still, gossip, wipe,\n",
      "and let it never grieve thee to wipe well, my little gossip; I will put\n",
      "thee into service to be wiper to Don Pedro de Castile; wipe, only wipe, and\n",
      "no more.  The poor fox wiped as hard as he could, here and there, within\n",
      "and without; but the false old trot did so fizzle and fist that she stunk\n",
      "like a hundred devils, which put the poor fox to a great deal of ill ease,\n",
      "for he knew not to what side to turn himself to escape the unsavoury\n",
      "perfume of this old woman's postern blasts.  And whilst to that effect he\n",
      "was shifting hither and thither, without knowing how to shun the annoyance\n",
      "of those unwholesome gusts, he saw that behind there was yet another hole,\n",
      "not so great as that which he did wipe, out of which came this filthy and\n",
      "infectious air.  The lion at last returned, bringing with him of moss more\n",
      "than eighteen packs would hold, and began to put into the wound with a\n",
      "staff which he had provided for that purpose, and had already put in full\n",
      "sixteen packs and a half, at which he was amazed.  What a devil! said he,\n",
      "this wound is very deep; it would hold above two cartloads of moss.  The\n",
      "fox, perceiving this, said unto the lion, O gossip lion, my friend, I pray\n",
      "thee do not put in all thy moss there; keep somewhat, for there is yet here\n",
      "another little hole, that stinks like five hundred devils; I am almost\n",
      "choked with the smell thereof, it is so pestiferous and empoisoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus must these walls be kept from the flies, and wages allowed to some for\n",
      "wiping of them.  Then said Pantagruel, How dost thou know that the privy\n",
      "parts of women are at such a cheap rate?  For in this city there are many\n",
      "virtuous, honest, and chaste women besides the maids.  Et ubi prenus? said\n",
      "Panurge.  I will give you my opinion of it, and that upon certain and\n",
      "assured knowledge.  I do not brag that I have bumbasted four hundred and\n",
      "seventeen since I came into this city, though it be but nine days ago; but\n",
      "this very morning I met with a good fellow, who, in a wallet such as\n",
      "Aesop's was, carried two little girls of two or three years old at the\n",
      "most, one before and the other behind.  He demanded alms of me, but I made\n",
      "him answer that I had more cods than pence.  Afterwards I asked him, Good\n",
      "man, these two girls, are they maids?  Brother, said he, I have carried\n",
      "them thus these two years, and in regard of her that is before, whom I see\n",
      "continually, in my opinion she is a virgin, nevertheless I will not put my\n",
      "finger in the fire for it; as for her that is behind, doubtless I can say\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, said Pantagruel, thou art a gentle companion; I will have thee to\n",
      "be apparelled in my livery.  And therefore caused him to be clothed most\n",
      "gallantly according to the fashion that then was, only that Panurge would\n",
      "have the codpiece of his breeches three foot long, and in shape square, not\n",
      "round; which was done, and was well worth the seeing.  Oftentimes was he\n",
      "wont to say, that the world had not yet known the emolument and utility\n",
      "that is in wearing great codpieces; but time would one day teach it them,\n",
      "as all things have been invented in time.  God keep from hurt, said he, the\n",
      "good fellow whose long codpiece or braguet hath saved his life!  God keep\n",
      "from hurt him whose long braguet hath been worth to him in one day one\n",
      "hundred threescore thousand and nine crowns!  God keep from hurt him who by\n",

      "Panurge was of a middle stature, not too high nor too low, and had somewhat\n",
      "an aquiline nose, made like the handle of a razor.  He was at that time\n",
      "five and thirty years old or thereabouts, fine to gild like a leaden\n",
      "dagger--for he was a notable cheater and coney-catcher--he was a very\n",
      "gallant and proper man of his person, only that he was a little lecherous,\n",
      "and naturally subject to a kind of disease which at that time they called\n",
      "lack of money--it is an incomparable grief, yet, notwithstanding, he had\n",
      "three score and three tricks to come by it at his need, of which the most\n",
      "honourable and most ordinary was in manner of thieving, secret purloining\n",
      "and filching, for he was a wicked lewd rogue, a cozener, drinker, roister,\n",
      "rover, and a very dissolute and debauched fellow, if there were any in\n",
      "Paris; otherwise, and in all matters else, the best and most virtuous man\n",
      "in the world; and he was still contriving some plot, and devising mischief\n",
      "against the sergeants and the watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one time he assembled three or four especial good hacksters and roaring\n",
      "boys, made them in the evening drink like Templars, afterwards led them\n",
      "till they came under St. Genevieve, or about the college of Navarre, and,\n",
      "at the hour that the watch was coming up that way--which he knew by putting\n",
      "his sword upon the pavement, and his ear by it, and, when he heard his\n",
      "sword shake, it was an infallible sign that the watch was near at that\n",
      "instant--then he and his companions took a tumbrel or dung-cart, and gave\n",
      "it the brangle, hurling it with all their force down the hill, and so\n",
      "overthrew all the poor watchmen like pigs, and then ran away upon the other\n",
      "side; for in less than two days he knew all the streets, lanes, and\n",
      "turnings in Paris as well as his Deus det.\n",
      "\n",
      "At another time he made in some fair place, where the said watch was to\n",
      "pass, a train of gunpowder, and, at the very instant that they went along,\n",
      "set fire to it, and then made himself sport to see what good grace they had\n",
      "in running away, thinking that St. Anthony's fire had caught them by the\n",
      "legs.  As for the poor masters of arts, he did persecute them above all\n",
      "others.  When he encountered with any of them upon the street, he would not\n",
      "never fail to put some trick or other upon them, sometimes putting the bit\n",
      "of a fried turd in their graduate hoods, at other times pinning on little\n",
      "foxtails or hares'-ears behind them, or some such other roguish prank.  One\n",
      "day that they were appointed all to meet in the Fodder Street (Sorbonne),\n",
      "he made a Borbonesa tart, or filthy and slovenly compound, made of store of\n",
      "garlic, of assafoetida, of castoreum, of dogs' turds very warm, which he\n",
      "steeped, tempered, and liquefied in the corrupt matter of pocky boils and\n",
      "pestiferous botches; and, very early in the morning therewith anointed all\n",
      "the pavement, in such sort that the devil could not have endured it, which\n",
      "made all these good people there to lay up their gorges, and vomit what was\n",
      "upon their stomachs before all the world, as if they had flayed the fox;\n",
      "and ten or twelve of them died of the plague, fourteen became lepers,\n",
      "eighteen grew lousy, and about seven and twenty had the pox, but he did not\n",
      "care a button for it.  He commonly carried a whip under his gown, wherewith\n",
      "he whipped without remission the pages whom he found carrying wine to their\n",
      "masters, to make them mend their pace.  In his coat he had above six and\n",
      "twenty little fobs and pockets always full; one with some lead-water, and a\n",
      "little knife as sharp as a glover's needle, wherewith he used to cut\n",

      "eyes of those he met; another with clotburrs, penned with little geese' or\n",
      "capon's feathers, which he cast upon the gowns and caps of honest people,\n",
      "and often made them fair horns, which they wore about all the city,\n",

      "would he stick in the hind part somewhat made in the shape of a man's\n",

      "lice, which he borrowed from the beggars of St. Innocent, and cast them\n",
      "with small canes or quills to write with into the necks of the daintiest\n",
      "gentlewomen that he could find, yea, even in the church, for he never\n",
      "seated himself above in the choir, but always sat in the body of the church\n",
      "amongst the women, both at mass, at vespers, and at sermon.  In another, he\n",

      "those that wore gowns of crimson taffeties, that, when they were about to\n",
      "go away, they might rend all their gowns.  In another, he had a squib\n",
      "furnished with tinder, matches, stones to strike fire, and all other\n",
      "tackling necessary for it.  In another, two or three burning glasses,\n",
      "wherewith he made both men and women sometimes mad, and in the church put\n",

      "missa est, that the poor frater would have laid by his stole or surplice,\n",
      "as the fashion then was, he plucked off withal both his frock and shirt,\n",
      "which were well sewed together, and thereby stripping himself up to the\n",
      "very shoulders showed his bel vedere to all the world, together with his\n",
      "Don Cypriano, which was no small one, as you may imagine.  And the friar\n",
      "still kept haling, but so much the more did he discover himself and lay\n",
      "open his back parts, till one of the lords of the court said, How now!\n",
      "what's the matter?  Will this fair father make us here an offering of his\n",
      "tail to kiss it?  Nay, St. Anthony's fire kiss it for us!  From thenceforth\n",
      "it was ordained that the poor fathers should never disrobe themselves any\n",

      "it; especially in the presence of women, lest it should tempt them to the\n",

      "the friars had so long and large genitories?  The said Panurge resolved the\n",

      "is that their dams did put no biggins on their heads, as Alliaco mentioneth\n",
      "in his Suppositions.  By the like reason, that which makes the genitories\n",

      "no bottomed breeches, and therefore their jolly member, having no\n",
      "impediment, hangeth dangling at liberty as far as it can reach, with a\n",
      "wiggle-waggle down to their knees, as women carry their paternoster beads.\n",
      "and the cause wherefore they have it so correspondently great is, that in\n",
      "this constant wig-wagging the humours of the body descend into the said\n",

      "Item, he had another pocket full of itching powder, called stone-alum,\n",
      "whereof he would cast some into the backs of those women whom he judged to\n",

      "would strip themselves in the open view of the world, and others dance like\n",
      "a cock upon hot embers, or a drumstick on a tabor.  Others, again, ran\n",
      "about the streets, and he would run after them.  To such as were in the\n",

      "One day I found Panurge very much out of countenance, melancholic, and\n",
      "silent; which made me suspect that he had no money; whereupon I said unto\n",
      "him, Panurge, you are sick, as I do very well perceive by your physiognomy,\n",
      "and I know the disease.  You have a flux in your purse; but take no care.\n",
      "I have yet sevenpence halfpenny that never saw father nor mother, which\n",
      "shall not be wanting, no more than the pox, in your necessity.  Whereunto\n",
      "he answered me, Well, well; for money one day I shall have but too much,\n",
      "for I have a philosopher's stone which attracts money out of men's purses\n",
      "as the adamant doth iron.  But will you go with me to gain the pardons?\n",
      "said he.  By my faith, said I, I am no great pardon-taker in this world--if\n",
      "I shall be any such in the other, I cannot tell; yet let us go, in God's\n",
      "name; it is but one farthing more or less; But, said he, lend me then a\n",
      "farthing upon interest.  No, no, said I; I will give it you freely, and\n",
      "from my heart.  Grates vobis dominos, said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went along, beginning at St. Gervase, and I got the pardons at the\n",
      "first box only, for in those matters very little contenteth me.  Then did I\n",
      "say my small suffrages and the prayers of St. Brigid; but he gained them\n",
      "all at the boxes, and always gave money to everyone of the pardoners.  From\n",
      "thence we went to Our Lady's Church, to St. John's, to St. Anthony's, and\n",
      "so to the other churches, where there was a banquet (bank) of pardons.  For\n",
      "my part, I gained no more of them, but he at all the boxes kissed the\n",
      "relics, and gave at everyone.  To be brief, when we were returned, he\n",
      "brought me to drink at the castle-tavern, and there showed me ten or twelve\n",
      "of his little bags full of money, at which I blessed myself, and made the\n",
      "sign of the cross, saying, Where have you recovered so much money in so\n",
      "little time?  Unto which he answered me that he had taken it out of the\n",

      "put it in with such sleight of hand and so dexterously that it appeared to\n",

      "sixpence at the least, and with the other as much, and so through all the\n",
      "churches where we have been.  Yea but, said I, you damn yourself like a\n",
      "snake, and are withal a thief and sacrilegious person.  True, said he, in\n",
      "your opinion, but I am not of that mind; for the pardoners do give me it,\n",
      "when they say unto me in presenting the relics to kiss, Centuplum accipies,\n",
      "that is, that for one penny I should take a hundred; for accipies is spoken\n",
      "according to the manner of the Hebrews, who use the future tense instead of\n",

      "it, and all the Massorets, et ibi Bartholus.  Moreover, Pope Sixtus gave me\n",

      "you, peace!  By G--, you rogues, if you trouble me here, I will cut off the\n",

      "and to know that of which I have doubted all my life long, and have neither\n",
      "found book nor man able to content me in the resolution of those doubts\n",

      "one towards the other, as if he had been devoutly to send up his prayers\n",

      "fingers straight out, and closed orderly in a parallel line to the point of\n",
      "his nose, shutting the left eye wholly, and making the other wink with a\n",
      "profound depression of the eyebrows and eyelids.  Then lifted he up his\n",

      "elevating his thumb, which he held in a line directly correspondent to the\n",
      "situation of his right hand, with the distance of a cubit and a half\n",
      "between them.  This done, in the same form he abased towards the ground\n",
      "about the one and the other hand.  Lastly, he held them in the midst, as\n",
      "aiming right at the Englishman's nose.  And if Mercury,--said the\n",

      "had done with the right.\n",

      "Panurge, being not a whit amazed at this, drew out into the air his\n",

      "truncheon of a white ox-rib, and two pieces of wood of a like form, one of\n",
      "black ebony and the other of incarnation brasil, and put them betwixt the\n",

      "such a noise as the lepers of Brittany use to do with their clappering\n",
      "clickets, yet better resounding and far more harmonious, and with his\n",
      "tongue contracted in his mouth did very merrily warble it, always looking\n",
      "fixedly upon the Englishman.  The divines, physicians, and chirurgeons that\n",
      "were there thought that by this sign he would have inferred that the\n",

      "medical of his right hand, holding them asunder as much as he could, and\n",
      "thrusting them towards Thaumast.  Then did he put the thumb of his left\n",
      "hand upon the corner of his left eye, stretching out all his hand like the\n",
      "wing of a bird or the fin of a fish, and moving it very daintily this way\n",
      "and that way, he did as much with his right hand upon the corner of his\n",

      "presently put the thumb of his right hand under his jaws, and the little\n",
      "finger thereof in the mouth of the left hand, and in this posture made his\n",
      "teeth to sound very melodiously, the upper against the lower.  With this\n",
      "Thaumast, with great toil and vexation of spirit, rose up, but in rising\n",
      "let a great baker's fart, for the bran came after, and pissing withal very\n",
      "strong vinegar, stunk like all the devils in hell.  The company began to\n",
      "stop their noses; for he had conskited himself with mere anguish and\n",
      "perplexity.  Then lifted he up his right hand, clunching it in such sort\n",
      "that he brought the ends of all his fingers to meet together, and his left\n",
      "hand he laid flat upon his breast.  Whereat Panurge drew out his long\n",
      "codpiece with his tuff, and stretched it forth a cubit and a half, holding\n",
      "it in the air with his right hand, and with his left took out his orange,\n",
      "and, casting it up into the air seven times, at the eighth he hid it in the\n",

      "shake his fair codpiece, showing it to Thaumast.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, Thaumast began to puff up his two cheeks like a player on a\n",
      "bagpipe, and blew as if he had been to puff up a pig's bladder.  Whereupon\n",
      "Panurge put one finger of his left hand in his nockandrow, by some called\n",
      "St. Patrick's hole, and with his mouth sucked in the air, in such a manner\n",
      "as when one eats oysters in the shell, or when we sup up our broth.  This\n",
      "done, he opened his mouth somewhat, and struck his right hand flat upon it,\n",
      "making therewith a great and a deep sound, as if it came from the\n",
      "superficies of the midriff through the trachiartery or pipe of the lungs,\n",
      "and this he did for sixteen times; but Thaumast did always keep blowing\n",
      "like a goose.  Then Panurge put the forefinger of his right hand into his\n",
      "mouth, pressing it very hard to the muscles thereof; then he drew it out,\n",
      "and withal made a great noise, as when little boys shoot pellets out of the\n",
      "pot-cannons made of the hollow sticks of the branch of an alder-tree, and\n",
      "he did it nine times.\n",
      "\n",

      "in his hand up to the elbow, then drew out a dagger that he had, holding it\n",
      "by the point downwards.  Whereat Panurge took his long codpiece, and shook\n",
      "it as hard as he could against his thighs; then put his two hands entwined\n",
      "in manner of a comb upon his head, laying out his tongue as far as he was\n",
      "able, and turning his eyes in his head like a goat that is ready to die.\n",

      "the haft of his dagger against his breast, and upon the point thereof the\n",
      "flat of his hand, turning in a little the ends of his fingers.  Whereat\n",
      "Panurge held down his head on the left side, and put his middle finger into\n",
      "his right ear, holding up his thumb bolt upright.  Then he crossed his two\n",
      "arms upon his breast and coughed five times, and at the fifth time he\n",
      "struck his right foot against the ground.  Then he lift up his left arm,\n",
      "and closing all his fingers into his fist, held his thumb against his\n",
      "forehead, striking with his right hand six times against his breast.  But\n",

      "me, or I you?  Whereunto she answered, As for me, I do not hate you; for,\n",
      "as God commands, I love all the world.  But to the purpose, said he; are\n",
      "not you in love with me?  I have, said she, told you so many times already\n",

      "all within the compass of the cables, and that his two companions were\n",
      "retired, making room for all those horses which came in a crowd, thronging\n",
      "upon the neck of one another to see the ship and such as were in it, cried\n",
      "out on a sudden to Epistemon, Draw, draw!  Then began Epistemon to wind\n",
      "about the capstan, by doing whereof the two cables so entangled and\n",
      "empestered the legs of the horses, that they were all of them thrown down\n",
      "to the ground easily, together with their riders.  But they, seeing that,\n",
      "drew their swords, and would have cut them; whereupon Panurge set fire to\n",
      "the train, and there burnt them up all like damned souls, both men and\n",
      "horses, not one escaping save one alone, who being mounted on a fleet\n",
      "Turkey courser, by mere speed in flight got himself out of the circle of\n",
      "the ropes.  But when Carpalin perceived him, he ran after him with such\n",
      "nimbleness and celerity that he overtook him in less than a hundred paces;\n",
      "then, leaping close behind him upon the crupper of his horse, clasped him\n",
      "in his arms, and brought him back to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "This exploit being ended, Pantagruel was very jovial, and wondrously\n",
      "commended the industry of these gentlemen, whom he called his\n",
      "fellow-soldiers, and made them refresh themselves and feed well and merrily\n",
      "upon the seashore, and drink heartily with their bellies upon the ground,\n",
      "and their prisoner with them, whom they admitted to that familiarity; only\n",
      "that the poor devil was somewhat afraid that Pantagruel would have eaten him\n",
      "up whole, which, considering the wideness of his mouth and capacity of his\n",
      "throat was no great matter for him to have done; for he could have done it\n",
      "as easily as you would eat a small comfit, he showing no more in his throat\n",

      "How Pantagruel and his company were weary in eating still salt meats; and\n",
      "how Carpalin went a-hunting to have some venison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus as they talked and chatted together, Carpalin said, And, by the belly\n",
      "of St. Quenet, shall we never eat any venison?  This salt meat makes me\n",
      "horribly dry.  I will go fetch you a quarter of one of those horses which\n",
      "we have burnt; it is well roasted already.  As he was rising up to go about\n",
      "it, he perceived under the side of a wood a fair great roebuck, which was\n",
      "come out of his fort, as I conceive, at the sight of Panurge's fire.  Him\n",
      "did he pursue and run after with as much vigour and swiftness as if it had\n",
      "been a bolt out of a crossbow, and caught him in a moment; and whilst he\n",
      "was in his course he with his hands took in the air four great bustards,\n",
      "seven bitterns, six and twenty grey partridges, two and thirty red-legged\n",
      "ones, sixteen pheasants, nine woodcocks, nineteen herons, two and thirty\n",
      "cushats and ringdoves; and with his feet killed ten or twelve hares and\n",
      "rabbits, which were then at relief and pretty big withal, eighteen rails in\n",
      "a knot together, with fifteen young wild-boars, two little beavers, and\n",
      "three great foxes.  So, striking the kid with his falchion athwart the\n",
      "head, he killed him, and, bearing him on his back, he in his return took up\n",
      "his hares, rails, and young wild-boars, and, as far off as he could be\n",
      "heard, cried out and said, Panurge, my friend, vinegar, vinegar!  Then the\n",
      "good Pantagruel, thinking he had fainted, commanded them to provide him\n",
      "some vinegar; but Panurge knew well that there was some good prey in hands,\n",
      "and forthwith showed unto noble Pantagruel how he was bearing upon his back\n",
      "a fair roebuck, and all his girdle bordered with hares.  Then immediately\n",
      "did Epistemon make, in the name of the nine Muses, nine antique wooden\n",
      "spits.  Eusthenes did help to flay, and Panurge placed two great cuirassier\n",
      "saddles in such sort that they served for andirons, and making their\n",
      "prisoner to be their cook, they roasted their venison by the fire wherein\n",
      "the horsemen were burnt; and making great cheer with a good deal of\n",
      "vinegar, the devil a one of them did forbear from his victuals--it was a\n",
      "triumphant and incomparable spectacle to see how they ravened and devoured.\n",

      "anthem or sacring bells hanging at your chin, and that I had at mine the\n",
      "great clocks of Rennes, of Poictiers, of Tours, and of Cambray, to see what\n",
      "a peal they would ring with the wagging of our chaps.  But, said Panurge,\n",
      "it were better we thought a little upon our business, and by what means we\n",
      "might get the upper hand of our enemies.  That is well remembered, said\n",
      "Pantagruel.  Therefore spoke he thus to the prisoner, My friend, tell us\n",
      "here the truth, and do not lie to us at all, if thou wouldst not be flayed\n",
      "alive, for it is I that eat the little children.  Relate unto us at full\n",
      "the order, the number, and the strength of the army.  To which the prisoner\n",
      "answered, Sir, know for a truth that in the army there are three hundred\n",
      "giants, all armed with armour of proof, and wonderful great.  Nevertheless,\n",
      "not fully so great as you, except one that is their head, named Loupgarou,\n",

      "he is there in person, and we call him Anarchus, king of the Dipsodes,\n",
      "which is as much to say as thirsty people, for you never saw men more\n",
      "thirsty, nor more willing to drink, and his tent is guarded by the giants.\n",
      "It is enough, said Pantagruel.  Come, brave boys, are you resolved to go\n",
      "with me?  To which Panurge answered, God confound him that leaves you!  I\n",
      "have already bethought myself how I will kill them all like pigs, and so\n",
      "the devil one leg of them shall escape.  But I am somewhat troubled about\n",
      "one thing.  And what is that? said Pantagruel.  It is, said Panurge, how I\n",

      "And Carpalin said:  The devil take these sink-holes, if, by G--, I do not\n",

      "that my needle could mount to ten or eleven o'clock, till now that I have\n",

      "\n",
      "How now! said Epistemon; everyone shall ride, and I must lead the ass?  The\n",

      "potest capere, capiat.  No, no, said Panurge, but tie thine ass to a crook,\n",
      "and ride as the world doth.  And the good Pantagruel laughed at all this,\n",
      "and said unto them, You reckon without your host.  I am much afraid that,\n",
      "before it be night, I shall see you in such taking that you will have no\n",

      "pike and lance.  Baste, said Epistemon, enough of that!  I will not fail to\n",
      "bring them to you, either to roast or boil, to fry or put in paste.  They\n",

      "  Here was the prowess made apparent of\n",

      "long about our victuals; for very seldom doth it fall out that the greatest\n",
      "eaters do the most martial exploits.  There is no shadow like that of\n",
      "flying colours, no smoke like that of horses, no clattering like that of\n",

      "like that of the kitchen, no smoke like that of pasties, and no clattering\n",
      "like that of goblets.  Unto which answered Panurge, There is no shadow like\n",
      "that of curtains, no smoke like that of women's breasts, and no clattering\n",
      "like that of ballocks.  Then forthwith rising up he gave a fart, a leap,\n",
      "and a whistle, and most joyfully cried out aloud, Ever live Pantagruel!\n",

      "ill-favoured dwarfs, and with one fisg that he let he made as many little\n",
      "women, crouching down, as you shall see in divers places, which never grow\n",
      "but like cow's tails, downwards, or, like the Limosin radishes, round.  How\n",
      "now! said Panurge, are your farts so fertile and fruitful?  By G--, here be\n",
      "brave farted men and fisgued women; let them be married together; they will\n",
      "beget fine hornets and dorflies.  So did Pantagruel, and called them\n",
      "pigmies.  Those he sent to live in an island thereby, where since that time\n",
      "they are increased mightily.  But the cranes make war with them\n",
      "continually, against which they do most courageously defend themselves; for\n",
      "these little ends of men and dandiprats (whom in Scotland they call\n",
      "whiphandles and knots of a tar-barrel) are commonly very testy and\n",

      "them upon one stool and the other upon another, placing them about one foot\n",
      "from one another.  Then he took the staff of a javelin, about five foot and\n",
      "a half long, and put it upon the two glasses, so that the two ends of the\n",
      "staff did come just to the brims of the glasses.  This done, he took a\n",
      "great stake or billet of wood, and said to Pantagruel and to the rest, My\n",
      "masters, behold how easily we shall have the victory over our enemies; for\n",
      "just as I shall break this staff here upon these glasses, without either\n",
      "breaking or crazing of them, nay, which is more, without spilling one drop\n",
      "of the water that is within them, even so shall we break the heads of our\n",

      "log.  Eusthenes did so, and the staff broke in two pieces, and not one drop\n",
      "of the water fell out of the glasses.  Then said he, I know a great many\n",

      "speedily and begone as he had told him, and to that effect gave him a\n",
      "boxful of euphorbium, together with some grains of the black chameleon\n",
      "thistle, steeped into aqua vitae, and made up into the condiment of a wet\n",
      "sucket, commanding him to carry it to his king, and to say unto him, that\n",

      "The prisoner then besought him with joined hands that in the hour of the\n",

      "him, After that thou hast delivered all unto the king, put thy whole\n",
      "confidence in God, and he will not forsake thee; because, although for my\n",
      "part I be mighty, as thou mayst see, and have an infinite number of men in\n",
      "arms, I do nevertheless trust neither in my force nor in mine industry, but\n",
      "all my confidence is in God my protector, who doth never forsake those that\n",
      "in him do put their trust and confidence.  This done, the prisoner\n",
      "requested him that he would afford him some reasonable composition for his\n",
      "ransom.  To which Pantagruel answered, that his end was not to rob nor\n",
      "ransom men, but to enrich them and reduce them to total liberty.  Go thy\n",
      "way, said he, in the peace of the living God, and never follow evil\n",

      "to-morrow at noon, to the end that they, doubting of the great arrival of\n",

      "must make a dinner ready for him, for at that hour he was resolved to set\n",
      "upon him.  Then did he give him that box wherein were those confitures.\n",
      "But as soon as he had swallowed down one spoonful of them, he was taken\n",
      "with such a heat in the throat, together with an ulceration in the flap of\n",
      "the top of the windpipe, that his tongue peeled with it in such sort that,\n",
      "for all they could do unto him, he found no ease at all but by drinking\n",
      "only without cessation; for as soon as ever he took the goblet from his\n",
      "head, his tongue was on a fire, and therefore they did nothing but still\n",
      "pour in wine into his throat with a funnel.  Which when his captains,\n",
      "bashaws, and guard of his body did see, they tasted of the same drugs to\n",
      "try whether they were so thirst-procuring and alterative or no.  But it so\n",
      "befell them as it had done their king, and they plied the flagon so well\n",
      "that the noise ran throughout all the camp, how the prisoner was returned;\n",
      "that the next day they were to have an assault; that the king and his\n",

      "of salt, as easily as the lansquenets carry their little panniers, and so\n",
      "set onward on his way with his fellow-soldiers.  When he was come near to\n",
      "the enemy's camp, Panurge said unto him, Sir, if you would do well, let\n",
      "down this white wine of Anjou from the scuttle of the mast of the ship,\n",
      "that we may all drink thereof, like Bretons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereunto Pantagruel very willingly consented, and they drank so neat that\n",
      "there was not so much as one poor drop left of two hundred and seven and\n",
      "thirty puncheons, except one boracho or leathern bottle of Tours which\n",
      "Panurge filled for himself, for he called that his vademecum, and some\n",
      "scurvy lees of wine in the bottom, which served him instead of vinegar.\n",
      "After they had whittled and curried the can pretty handsomely, Panurge gave\n",
      "Pantagruel to eat some devilish drugs compounded of lithotripton, which is\n",
      "a stone-dissolving ingredient, nephrocatarticon, that purgeth the reins,\n",
      "the marmalade of quinces, called codiniac, a confection of cantharides,\n",
      "which are green flies breeding on the tops of olive-trees, and other kinds\n",
      "of diuretic or piss-procuring simples.  This done, Pantagruel said to\n",
      "Carpalin, Go into the city, scrambling like a cat against the wall, as you\n",
      "can well do, and tell them that now presently they come out and charge\n",
      "their enemies as rudely as they can, and having said so, come down, taking\n",
      "a lighted torch with you, wherewith you shall set on fire all the tents and\n",
      "pavilions in the camp; then cry as loud as you are able with your great\n",
      "voice, and then come away from thence.  Yea but, said Carpalin, were it not\n",
      "good to cloy all their ordnance?  No, no, said Pantagruel, only blow up all\n",
      "their powder.  Carpalin, obeying him, departed suddenly and did as he was\n",
      "appointed by Pantagruel, and all the combatants came forth that were in the\n",
      "city, and when he had set fire in the tents and pavilions, he passed so\n",
      "lightly through them, and so highly and profoundly did they snort and\n",
      "sleep, that they never perceived him.  He came to the place where their\n",
      "artillery was, and set their munition on fire.  But here was the danger.\n",
      "The fire was so sudden that poor Carpalin had almost been burnt.  And had\n",
      "it not been for his wonderful agility he had been fried like a roasting\n",
      "pig.  But he departed away so speedily that a bolt or arrow out of a\n",
      "crossbow could not have had a swifter motion.  When he was clear of their\n",
      "trenches, he shouted aloud, and cried out so dreadfully, and with such\n",
      "amazement to the hearers, that it seemed all the devils of hell had been\n",
      "let loose.  At which noise the enemies awaked, but can you tell how?  Even\n",
      "no less astonished than are monks at the ringing of the first peal to\n",
      "matins, which in Lusonnois is called rub-ballock.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime Pantagruel began to sow the salt that he had in his bark,\n",
      "and because they slept with an open gaping mouth, he filled all their\n",
      "throats with it, so that those poor wretches were by it made to cough like\n",
      "foxes.  Ha, Pantagruel, how thou addest greater heat to the firebrand that\n",
      "is in us!  Suddenly Pantagruel had will to piss, by means of the drugs\n",
      "which Panurge had given him, and pissed amidst the camp so well and so\n",
      "copiously that he drowned them all, and there was a particular deluge ten\n",
      "leagues round about, of such considerable depth that the history saith, if\n",
      "his father's great mare had been there, and pissed likewise, it would\n",
      "undoubtedly have been a more enormous deluge than that of Deucalion; for\n",
      "she did never piss but she made a river greater than is either the Rhone or\n",
      "the Danube.  Which those that were come out of the city seeing, said, They\n",
      "are all cruelly slain; see how the blood runs along.  But they were\n",
      "deceived in thinking Pantagruel's urine had been the blood of their\n",
      "enemies, for they could not see but by the light of the fire of the\n",
      "pavilions and some small light of the moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enemies, after that they were awaked, seeing on one side the fire in\n",
      "the camp, and on the other the inundation of the urinal deluge, could not\n",
      "tell what to say nor what to think.  Some said that it was the end of the\n",
      "world and the final judgment, which ought to be by fire.  Others again\n",
      "thought that the sea-gods, Neptune, Proteus, Triton, and the rest of them,\n",
      "did persecute them, for that indeed they found it to be like sea-water and\n",

      "\n",
      "The giants, seeing all their camp drowned, carried away their king Anarchus\n",
      "upon their backs as well as they could out of the fort, as Aeneas did to\n",
      "his father Anchises, in the time of the conflagration of Troy.  When\n",
      "Panurge perceived them, he said to Pantagruel, Sir, yonder are the giants\n",
      "coming forth against you; lay on them with your mast gallantly, like an old\n",
      "fencer; for now is the time that you must show yourself a brave man and an\n",
      "honest.  And for our part we will not fail you.  I myself will kill to you\n",
      "a good many boldly enough; for why, David killed Goliath very easily; and\n",
      "then this great lecher, Eusthenes, who is stronger than four oxen, will not\n",
      "spare himself.  Be of good courage, therefore, and valiant; charge amongst\n",
      "them with point and edge, and by all manner of means.  Well, said\n",
      "Pantagruel, of courage I have more than for fifty francs, but let us be\n",
      "wise, for Hercules first never undertook against two.  That is well cacked,\n",
      "well scummered, said Panurge; do you compare yourself with Hercules?  You\n",
      "have, by G--, more strength in your teeth, and more scent in your bum, than\n",
      "ever Hercules had in all his body and soul.  So much is a man worth as he\n",
      "esteems himself.  Whilst they spake those words, behold! Loupgarou was come\n",
      "with all his giants, who, seeing Pantagruel in a manner alone, was carried\n",
      "away with temerity and presumption, for hopes that he had to kill the good\n",
      "man.  Whereupon he said to his companions the giants, You wenchers of the\n",
      "low country, by Mahoom! if any of you undertake to fight against these men\n",
      "here, I will put you cruelly to death.  It is my will that you let me fight\n",
      "single.  In the meantime you shall have good sport to look upon us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then all the other giants retired with their king to the place where the\n",
      "flagons stood, and Panurge and his comrades with them, who counterfeited\n",
      "those that have had the pox, for he wreathed about his mouth, shrunk up his\n",
      "fingers, and with a harsh and hoarse voice said unto them, I forsake -od,\n",
      "fellow-soldiers, if I would have it to be believed that we make any war at\n",
      "all.  Give us somewhat to eat with you whilest our masters fight against\n",
      "one another.  To this the king and giants jointly condescended, and\n",
      "accordingly made them to banquet with them.  In the meantime Panurge told\n",
      "them the follies of Turpin, the examples of St. Nicholas, and the tale of a\n",
      "tub.  Loupgarou then set forward towards Pantagruel, with a mace all of\n",
      "steel, and that of the best sort, weighing nine thousand seven hundred\n",
      "quintals and two quarterons, at the end whereof were thirteen pointed\n",
      "diamonds, the least whereof was as big as the greatest bell of Our Lady's\n",
      "Church at Paris--there might want perhaps the thickness of a nail, or at\n",
      "most, that I may not lie, of the back of those knives which they call\n",
      "cutlugs or earcutters, but for a little off or on, more or less, it is no\n",
      "matter--and it was enchanted in such sort that it could never break, but,\n",
      "contrarily, all that it did touch did break immediately.  Thus, then, as he\n",
      "approached with great fierceness and pride of heart, Pantagruel, casting up\n",
      "his eyes to heaven, recommended himself to God with all his soul, making\n",
      "such a vow as followeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "O thou Lord God, who hast always been my protector and my saviour! thou\n",
      "seest the distress wherein I am at this time.  Nothing brings me hither but\n",
      "a natural zeal, which thou hast permitted unto mortals, to keep and defend\n",
      "themselves, their wives and children, country and family, in case thy own\n",
      "proper cause were not in question, which is the faith; for in such a\n",
      "business thou wilt have no coadjutors, only a catholic confession and\n",
      "service of thy word, and hast forbidden us all arming and defence.  For\n",
      "thou art the Almighty, who in thine own cause, and where thine own business\n",
      "is taken to heart, canst defend it far beyond all that we can conceive,\n",
      "thou who hast thousand thousands of hundreds of millions of legions of\n",
      "angels, the least of which is able to kill all mortal men, and turn about\n",
      "the heavens and earth at his pleasure, as heretofore it very plainly\n",
      "appeared in the army of Sennacherib.  If it may please thee, therefore, at\n",
      "this time to assist me, as my whole trust and confidence is in thee alone,\n",
      "I vow unto thee, that in all countries whatsoever wherein I shall have any\n",
      "power or authority, whether in this of Utopia or elsewhere, I will cause\n",
      "thy holy gospel to be purely, simply, and entirely preached, so that the\n",
      "abuses of a rabble of hypocrites and false prophets, who by human\n",
      "constitutions and depraved inventions have empoisoned all the world, shall\n",
      "be quite exterminated from about me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This vow was no sooner made, but there was heard a voice from heaven\n",
      "saying, Hoc fac et vinces; that is to say, Do this, and thou shalt\n",
      "overcome.  Then Pantagruel, seeing that Loupgarou with his mouth wide open\n",
      "was drawing near to him, went against him boldly, and cried out as loud as\n",
      "he was able, Thou diest, villain, thou diest! purposing by his horrible cry\n",
      "to make him afraid, according to the discipline of the Lacedaemonians.\n",
      "Withal, he immediately cast at him out of his bark, which he wore at his\n",
      "girdle, eighteen cags and four bushels of salt, wherewith he filled both\n",
      "his mouth, throat, nose, and eyes.  At this Loupgarou was so highly\n",
      "incensed that, most fiercely setting upon him, he thought even then with a\n",
      "blow of his mace to have beat out his brains.  But Pantagruel was very\n",
      "nimble, and had always a quick foot and a quick eye, and therefore with his\n",
      "left foot did he step back one pace, yet not so nimbly but that the blow,\n",
      "falling upon the bark, broke it in four thousand four score and six pieces,\n",
      "and threw all the rest of the salt about the ground.  Pantagruel, seeing\n",
      "that, most gallantly displayed the vigour of his arms, and, according to\n",
      "the art of the axe, gave him with the great end of his mast a homethrust a\n",
      "little above the breast; then, bringing along the blow to the left side,\n",
      "with a slash struck him between the neck and shoulders.  After that,\n",
      "advancing his right foot, he gave him a push upon the couillons with the\n",
      "upper end of his said mast, wherewith breaking the scuttle on the top\n",
      "thereof, he spilt three or four puncheons of wine that were left therein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon that Loupgarou thought that he had pierced his bladder, and that the\n",
      "wine that came forth had been his urine.  Pantagruel, being not content\n",
      "with this, would have doubled it by a side-blow; but Loupgarou, lifting\n",
      "up his mace, advanced one step upon him, and with all his force would\n",
      "have dashed it upon Pantagruel, wherein, to speak the truth, he so\n",
      "sprightfully carried himself, that, if God had not succoured the good\n",
      "Pantagruel, he had been cloven from the top of his head to the bottom of\n",
      "his milt.  But the blow glanced to the right side by the brisk nimbleness\n",
      "of Pantagruel, and his mace sank into the ground above threescore and\n",
      "thirteen foot, through a huge rock, out of which the fire did issue greater\n",
      "than nine thousand and six tons.  Pantagruel, seeing him busy about\n",
      "plucking out his mace, which stuck in the ground between the rocks, ran\n",
      "upon him, and would have clean cut off his head, if by mischance his mast\n",
      "had not touched a little against the stock of Loupgarou's mace, which was\n",
      "enchanted, as we have said before.  By this means his mast broke off about\n",
      "three handfuls above his hand, whereat he stood amazed like a bell-founder,\n",
      "and cried out, Ah, Panurge, where art thou?  Panurge, seeing that, said to\n",
      "the king and the giants, By G--, they will hurt one another if they be not\n",
      "parted.  But the giants were as merry as if they had been at a wedding.\n",
      "Then Carpalin would have risen from thence to help his master; but one of\n",
      "the giants said unto him, By Golfarin, the nephew of Mahoom, if thou stir\n",
      "hence I will put thee in the bottom of my breeches instead of a\n",
      "suppository, which cannot choose but do me good.  For in my belly I am very\n",
      "costive, and cannot well cagar without gnashing my teeth and making many\n",
      "filthy faces.  Then Pantagruel, thus destitute of a staff, took up the end\n",
      "of his mast, striking athwart and alongst upon the giant, but he did him no\n",
      "more hurt than you would do with a fillip upon a smith's anvil.  In the\n",
      "(mean) time Loupgarou was drawing his mace out of the ground, and, having\n",
      "already plucked it out, was ready therewith to have struck Pantagruel, who,\n",
      "being very quick in turning, avoided all his blows in taking only the\n",
      "defensive part in hand, until on a sudden he saw that Loupgarou did\n",
      "threaten him with these words, saying, Now, villain, will not I fail to\n",
      "chop thee as small as minced meat, and keep thee henceforth from ever\n",
      "making any more poor men athirst!  For then, without any more ado,\n",
      "Pantagruel struck him such a blow with his foot against the belly that he\n",
      "made him fall backwards, his heels over his head, and dragged him thus\n",
      "along at flay-buttock above a flight-shot.  Then Loupgarou cried out,\n",
      "bleeding at the throat, Mahoom, Mahoom, Mahoom! at which noise all the\n",
      "giants arose to succour him.  But Panurge said unto them, Gentlemen, do not\n",
      "go, if will believe me, for our master is mad, and strikes athwart and\n",
      "alongst, he cares not where; he will do you a mischief.  But the giants\n",
      "made no account of it, seeing that Pantagruel had never a staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when Pantagruel saw those giants approach very near unto him, he took\n",
      "Loupgarou by the two feet, and lift up his body like a pike in the air,\n",
      "wherewith, it being harnessed with anvils, he laid such heavy load amongst\n",
      "those giants armed with free-stone, that, striking them down as a mason\n",
      "doth little knobs of stones, there was not one of them that stood before\n",
      "him whom he threw not flat to the ground.  And by the breaking of this\n",
      "stony armour there was made such a horrible rumble as put me in mind of the\n",
      "fall of the butter-tower of St. Stephen's at Bourges when it melted before\n",
      "the sun.  Panurge, with Carpalin and Eusthenes, did cut in the mean time\n",
      "the throats of those that were struck down, in such sort that there escaped\n",
      "not one.  Pantagruel to any man's sight was like a mower, who with his\n",
      "scythe, which was Loupgarou, cut down the meadow grass, to wit, the giants;\n",
      "but with this fencing of Pantagruel's Loupgarou lost his head, which\n",
      "happened when Pantagruel struck down one whose name was Riflandouille, or\n",
      "Pudding-plunderer, who was armed cap-a-pie with Grison stones, one chip\n",
      "whereof splintering abroad cut off Epistemon's neck clean and fair.  For\n",
      "otherwise the most part of them were but lightly armed with a kind of sandy\n",
      "brittle stone, and the rest with slates.  At last, when he saw that they\n",
      "were all dead, he threw the body of Loupgarou as hard as he could against\n",
      "the city, where falling like a frog upon his belly in the great Piazza\n",
      "thereof, he with the said fall killed a singed he-cat, a wet she-cat, a\n",

      "in the face whilst he was about the cutting of his throat, and Epistemon,\n",
      "who appeared not at all.  Whereat Pantagruel was so aggrieved that he would\n",
      "have killed himself.  But Panurge said unto him, Nay, sir, stay a while,\n",
      "and we will search for him amongst the dead, and find out the truth of all.\n",
      "Thus as they went seeking after him, they found him stark dead, with his\n",
      "head between his arms all bloody.  Then Eusthenes cried out, Ah, cruel\n",
      "death! hast thou taken from me the perfectest amongst men?  At which words\n",
      "Pantagruel rose up with the greatest grief that ever any man did see, and\n",
      "said to Panurge, Ha, my friend! the prophecy of your two glasses and the\n",
      "javelin staff was a great deal too deceitful.  But Panurge answered, My\n",
      "dear bullies all, weep not one drop more, for, he being yet all hot, I will\n",
      "make him as sound as ever he was.  In saying this, he took the head and\n",
      "held it warm foregainst his codpiece, that the wind might not enter into\n",
      "it.  Eusthenes and Carpalin carried the body to the place where they had\n",
      "banqueted, not out of any hope that ever he would recover, but that\n",
      "Pantagruel might see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless Panurge gave him very good comfort, saying, If I do not heal\n",
      "him, I will be content to lose my head, which is a fool's wager.  Leave\n",
      "off, therefore, crying, and help me.  Then cleansed he his neck very well\n",
      "with pure white wine, and, after that, took his head, and into it synapised\n",
      "some powder of diamerdis, which he always carried about him in one of his\n",
      "bags.  Afterwards he anointed it with I know not what ointment, and set it\n",
      "on very just, vein against vein, sinew against sinew, and spondyle against\n",
      "spondyle, that he might not be wry-necked--for such people he mortally\n",
      "hated.  This done, he gave it round about some fifteen or sixteen stitches\n",
      "with a needle that it might not fall off again; then, on all sides and\n",
      "everywhere, he put a little ointment on it, which he called resuscitative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Epistemon began to breathe, then opened his eyes, yawned, sneezed,\n",
      "and afterwards let a great household fart.  Whereupon Panurge said, Now,\n",
      "certainly, he is healed,--and therefore gave him to drink a large full\n",
      "glass of strong white wine, with a sugared toast.  In this fashion was\n",
      "Epistemon finely healed, only that he was somewhat hoarse for above three\n",
      "weeks together, and had a dry cough of which he could not be rid but by the\n",
      "force of continual drinking.  And now he began to speak, and said that he\n",
      "had seen the devil, had spoken with Lucifer familiarly, and had been very\n",
      "merry in hell and in the Elysian fields, affirming very seriously before\n",
      "them all that the devils were boon companions and merry fellows.  But, in\n",
      "respect of the damned, he said he was very sorry that Panurge had so soon\n",
      "called him back into this world again; for, said he, I took wonderful\n",
      "delight to see them.  How so? said Pantagruel.  Because they do not use\n",
      "them there, said Epistemon, so badly as you think they do.  Their estate\n",
      "and condition of living is but only changed after a very strange manner;\n",

      "large field, they were overtaken with a great shower of rain, whereat they\n",

      "nothing but a little dew; but, howsoever, that they should put themselves\n",
      "in order, and he would cover them.  Then did they put themselves in a close\n",
      "order, and stood as near to (each) other as they could, and Pantagruel drew\n",
      "out his tongue only half-way and covered them all, as a hen doth her\n",
      "chickens.  In the meantime, I, who relate to you these so veritable\n",
      "stories, hid myself under a burdock-leaf, which was not much less in\n",
      "largeness than the arch of the bridge of Montrible, but when I saw them\n",

      "not do, for that they were so, as the saying is, At the yard's end there is\n",

      "an earth, whereof the inhabitants enjoy the light of a sun and a moon, and\n",

      "visible manner, as satyrs use to wear and carry them; but she will be so\n",

      "break her marriage-oath, infringe all matrimonial ties, prostitute her body\n",

      "clearly and manifestly explained and expounded by Artemidorus just as I\n",
      "have related it.  Nor will there be any metamorphosis or transmutation made\n",
      "of you into a drum or tabor, but you will surely be as soundly beaten as\n",
      "ever was tabor at a merry wedding.  Nor yet will she be changed into a\n",

      "For many times, in their interpretation, right witty, learned, and\n",

      "person of a most posed, staid, and grave behaviour; not naked, young, and\n",
      "beardless, as he was portrayed most usually amongst the Grecians.  Let us\n",

      "he had done, she drew him aside to a privy room, and then made a most\n",
      "lively alluring sign unto him to show that the game did please her.\n",

      "yawning made without his mouth with the thumb of his right hand the figure\n",
      "of the Greek letter Tau by frequent reiterations.  Afterwards he lifted up\n",
      "his eyes to heavenwards, then turned them in his head like a she-goat in\n",
      "the painful fit of an absolute birth, in doing whereof he did cough and\n",
      "sigh exceeding heavily.  This done, after that he had made demonstration of\n",
      "the want of his codpiece, he from under his shirt took his placket-racket\n",
      "in a full grip, making it therewithal clack very melodiously betwixt his\n",
      "thighs; then, no sooner had he with his body stooped a little forwards, and\n",
      "bowed his left knee, but that immediately thereupon holding both his arms\n",
      "on his breast, in a loose faint-like posture, the one over the other, he\n",
      "paused awhile.  Goatsnose looked wistly upon him, and having heedfully\n",
      "enough viewed him all over, he lifted up into the air his left hand, the\n",
      "whole fingers whereof he retained fistwise close together, except the thumb\n",
      "and the forefinger, whose nails he softly joined and coupled to one\n",
      "another.  I understand, quoth Pantagruel, what he meaneth by that sign.  It\n",
      "denotes marriage, and withal the number thirty, according to the profession\n",
      "of the Pythagoreans.  You will be married.  Thanks to you, quoth Panurge,\n",
      "in turning himself towards Goatsnose, my little sewer, pretty master's\n",
      "mate, dainty bailie, curious sergeant-marshal, and jolly catchpole-leader.\n",
      "Then did he lift higher up than before his said left hand, stretching out\n",
      "all the five fingers thereof, and severing them as wide from one another as\n",
      "he possibly could get done.  Here, says Pantagruel, doth he more amply and\n",
      "fully insinuate unto us, by the token which he showeth forth of the quinary\n",
      "number, that you shall be married.  Yea, that you shall not only be\n",
      "affianced, betrothed, wedded, and married, but that you shall furthermore\n",
      "cohabit and live jollily and merrily with your wife; for Pythagoras called\n",
      "five the nuptial number, which, together with marriage, signifieth the\n",
      "consummation of matrimony, because it is composed of a ternary, the first\n",
      "of the odd, and binary, the first of the even numbers, as of a male and\n",
      "female knit and united together.  In very deed it was the fashion of old in\n",
      "the city of Rome at marriage festivals to light five wax tapers; nor was it\n",
      "permitted to kindle any more at the magnific nuptials of the most potent\n",
      "and wealthy, nor yet any fewer at the penurious weddings of the poorest and\n",
      "most abject of the world.  Moreover, in times past, the heathen or paynims\n",
      "implored the assistance of five deities, or of one helpful, at least, in\n",
      "five several good offices to those that were to be married.  Of this sort\n",
      "were the nuptial Jove, Juno, president of the feast, the fair Venus, Pitho,\n",
      "the goddess of eloquence and persuasion, and Diana, whose aid and succour\n",
      "was required to the labour of child-bearing.  Then shouted Panurge, O the\n",

      "by Mirebalais!  Hereupon the dumb fellow sneezeth with an impetuous\n",
      "vehemency and huge concussion of the spirits of the whole body, withdrawing\n",
      "himself in so doing with a jerking turn towards the left hand.  By the body\n",
      "of a fox new slain, quoth Pantagruel, what is that?  This maketh nothing\n",
      "for your advantage; for he betokeneth thereby that your marriage will be\n",
      "inauspicious and unfortunate.  This sneezing, according to the doctrine of\n",
      "Terpsion, is the Socratic demon.  If done towards the right side, it\n",
      "imports and portendeth that boldly and with all assurance one may go\n",

      "shall be pleased to have thereupon taken; his entries in the beginning,\n",
      "progress in his proceedings, and success in the events and issues will be\n",
      "all lucky, good, and happy.  The quite contrary thereto is thereby implied\n",
      "and presaged if it be done towards the left.  You, quoth Panurge, do take\n",
      "always the matter at the worst, and continually, like another Davus,\n",
      "casteth in new disturbances and obstructions; nor ever yet did I know this\n",
      "old paltry Terpsion worthy of citation but in points only of cosenage and\n",

      "left side, and drew forth his tongue half out of his mouth.  This done, he\n",
      "posited his left hand wholly open, the mid-finger wholly excepted, which\n",
      "was perpendicularly placed upon the palm thereof, and set it just in the\n",
      "room where his codpiece had been.  Then did he keep his right hand\n",
      "altogether shut up in a fist, save only the thumb, which he straight turned\n",
      "backwards directly under the right armpit, and settled it afterwards on\n",
      "that most eminent part of the buttocks which the Arabs call the Al-Katim.\n",
      "Suddenly thereafter he made this interchange:  he held his right hand after\n",
      "the manner of the left, and posited it on the place wherein his codpiece\n",
      "sometime was, and retaining his left hand in the form and fashion of the\n",
      "right, he placed it upon his Al-Katim.  This altering of hands did he\n",
      "reiterate nine several times; at the last whereof he reseated his eyelids\n",
      "into their own first natural position.  Then doing the like also with his\n",
      "jaws and tongue, he did cast a squinting look upon Goatsnose, diddering and\n",
      "shivering his chaps, as apes use to do nowadays, and rabbits, whilst,\n",
      "almost starved with hunger, they are eating oats in the sheaf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then was it that Goatsnose, lifting up into the air his right hand wholly\n",
      "open and displayed, put the thumb thereof, even close unto its first\n",
      "articulation, between the two third joints of the middle and ring fingers,\n",
      "pressing about the said thumb thereof very hard with them both, and, whilst\n",
      "the remanent joints were contracted and shrunk in towards the wrist, he\n",
      "stretched forth with as much straightness as he could the fore and little\n",
      "fingers.  That hand thus framed and disposed of he laid and posited upon\n",
      "Panurge's navel, moving withal continually the aforesaid thumb, and bearing\n",
      "up, supporting, or under-propping that hand upon the above-specified fore\n",
      "and little fingers, as upon two legs.  Thereafter did he make in this\n",
      "posture his hand by little and little, and by degrees and pauses,\n",
      "successively to mount from athwart the belly to the stomach, from whence he\n",
      "made it to ascend to the breast, even upwards to Panurge's neck, still\n",
      "gaining ground, till, having reached his chin, he had put within the\n",
      "concave of his mouth his afore-mentioned thumb; then fiercely brandishing\n",
      "the whole hand, which he made to rub and grate against his nose, he heaved\n",
      "it further up, and made the fashion as if with the thumb thereof he would\n",
      "have put out his eyes.  With this Panurge grew a little angry, and went\n",
      "about to withdraw and rid himself from this ruggedly untoward dumb devil.\n",
      "But Goatsnose in the meantime, prosecuting the intended purpose of his\n",
      "prognosticatory response, touched very rudely, with the above-mentioned\n",
      "shaking thumb, now his eyes, then his forehead, and after that the borders\n",
      "and corners of his cap.  At last Panurge cried out, saying, Before God,\n",
      "master fool, if you do not let me alone, or that you will presume to vex me\n",
      "any more, you shall receive from the best hand I have a mask wherewith to\n",
      "cover your rascally scroundrel face, you paltry shitten varlet.  Then said\n",
      "Friar John, He is deaf, and doth not understand what thou sayest unto him.\n",
      "Bulliballock, make sign to him of a hail of fisticuffs upon the muzzle.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the devil, quoth Panurge, means this busy restless fellow?  What is it\n",
      "that this polypragmonetic ardelion to all the fiends of hell doth aim at?\n",
      "He hath almost thrust out mine eyes, as if he had been to poach them in a\n",
      "skillet with butter and eggs.  By God, da jurandi, I will feast you with\n",
      "flirts and raps on the snout, interlarded with a double row of bobs and\n",
      "finger-fillipings!  Then did he leave him in giving him by way of salvo a\n",
      "volley of farts for his farewell.  Goatsnose, perceiving Panurge thus to\n",
      "slip away from him, got before him, and, by mere strength enforcing him to\n",
      "stand, made this sign unto him.  He let fall his right arm toward his knee\n",
      "on the same side as low as he could, and, raising all the fingers of that\n",
      "hand into a close fist, passed his dexter thumb betwixt the foremost and\n",
      "mid fingers thereto belonging.  Then scrubbing and swingeing a little with\n",
      "his left hand alongst and upon the uppermost in the very bough of the elbow\n",
      "of the said dexter arm, the whole cubit thereof, by leisure, fair and\n",

      "new frock, provided that in the transporting of him over the water he would\n",
      "bear him upon his neck and shoulders, after the manner of carrying dead\n",

      "carry on us any kind of money.  Thou art truly unhappy, for having made me\n",
      "in this point to commit a heinous trespass.  Why didst thou not leave thy\n",
      "purse with the miller?  Without fail thou shalt presently receive thy\n",
      "reward for it; and if ever hereafter I may but lay hold upon thee within\n",
      "the limits of our chancel at Mirebeau, thou shalt have the Miserere even to\n",
      "the Vitulos.  With this, suddenly discharging himself of his burden, he\n",
      "throws me down your Dodin headlong.  Take example by this Dodin, my dear\n",
      "friend Friar John, to the end that the devils may the better carry thee\n",
      "away at thine own ease.  Give me thy purse.  Carry no manner of cross upon\n",
      "thee.  Therein lieth an evident and manifestly apparent danger.  For if you\n",
      "have any silver coined with a cross upon it, they will cast thee down\n",
      "headlong upon some rocks, as the eagles use to do with the tortoises for\n",
      "the breaking of their shells, as the bald pate of the poet Aeschylus can\n",
      "sufficiently bear witness.  Such a fall would hurt thee very sore, my sweet\n",
      "bully, and I would be sorry for it.  Or otherwise they will let thee fall\n",
      "and tumble down into the high swollen waves of some capacious sea, I know\n",

      "Secondly, be out of debt.  For the devils carry a great liking to those\n",
      "that are out of debt.  I have sore felt the experience thereof in mine own\n",

      "me, and making much of me, which they never did when I was all to pieces.\n",
      "The soul of one in debt is insipid, dry, and heretical altogether.\n",

      "nail on the head, quoth Panurge, and speakest like a learned doctor, subtle\n",
      "and well-skilled in the art of devilry.  At the time when I was a student\n",
      "in the University of Toulouse (Tolette), that same reverend father in the\n",
      "devil, Picatrix, rector of the diabological faculty, was wont to tell us\n",
      "that the devils did naturally fear the bright glancing of swords as much as\n",
      "the splendour and light of the sun.  In confirmation of the verity whereof\n",
      "he related this story, that Hercules, at his descent into hell to all the\n",
      "devils of those regions, did not by half so much terrify them with his club\n",
      "and lion's skin as afterwards Aeneas did with his clear shining armour upon\n",
      "him, and his sword in his hand well-furbished and unrusted, by the aid,\n",
      "counsel, and assistance of the Sybilla Cumana.  That was perhaps the reason\n",
      "why the senior John Jacomo di Trivulcio, whilst he was a-dying at Chartres,\n",
      "called for his cutlass, and died with a drawn sword in his hand, laying\n",
      "about him alongst and athwart around the bed and everywhere within his\n",
      "reach, like a stout, doughty, valorous and knight-like cavalier; by which\n",
      "resolute manner of fence he scared away and put to flight all the devils\n",
      "that were then lying in wait for his soul at the passage of his death.\n",
      "When the Massorets and Cabalists are asked why it is that none of all the\n",

      "My most ancient friend and gossip, thou seest the perplexity of my\n",

      "able to help and succour me?  Epistemon, thereupon taking the speech in\n",

      "whole country did run upon no other discourse but the derision and mockery\n",
      "of his new disguise; wherefore his counsel unto him was that he would in\n",
      "the first place be pleased to make use of a little hellebore for the\n",
      "purging of his brain of that peccant humour which, through that extravagant\n",
      "and fantastic mummery of his, had furnished the people with a too just\n",
      "occasion of flouting and gibing, jeering and scoffing him, and that next he\n",

      "and resolution to marry, but am afraid of being a cuckold and to be\n",
      "unfortunate in my wedlock.  For this cause have I made a vow to young St.\n",
      "Francis--who at Plessis-les-Tours is much reverenced of all women,\n",
      "earnestly cried unto by them, and with great devotion, for he was the first\n",

      "It is a shame to you, and I wonder much at it, that you do not return unto\n",
      "yourself, and recall your senses from this their wild swerving and straying\n",
      "abroad to that rest and stillness which becomes a virtuous man.  This\n",

      "the Lacedaemonians for the territory of Thyrea, lost the battle which they\n",
      "hoped should have decided it for their advantage, vowed to carry never any\n",

      "of adventures past, with great confidence opened up present cases and\n",
      "accidents, and stoutly professed the presaging of all future events and\n",

      "covered with a velvet scabbard, and with fifty good single angels; then in\n",
      "a familiar and friendly way did he ask of him his opinion touching the\n",
      "affair.  At the very first Herr Trippa, looking on him very wistly in the\n",
      "face, said unto him:  Thou hast the metoposcopy and physiognomy of a\n",
      "cuckold,--I say, of a notorious and infamous cuckold.  With this, casting\n",

      "fetched a deep sigh, and said:  I have clearly enough already discovered\n",
      "unto you the fate of your cuckoldry, which is unavoidable, you cannot\n",
      "escape it.  And here have I got of new a further assurance thereof, so that\n",

      "How the physician Rondibilis counselleth Panurge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Panurge, continuing his discourse, said, The first word which was spoken by\n",
      "him who gelded the lubberly, quaffing monks of Saussiniac, after that he\n",
      "had unstoned Friar Cauldaureil, was this, To the rest.  In like manner, I\n",
      "say, To the rest.  Therefore I beseech you, my good Master Rondibilis,\n",
      "should I marry or not?  By the raking pace of my mule, quoth Rondibilis, I\n",
      "know not what answer to make to this problem of yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "You say that you feel in you the pricking stings of sensuality, by which\n",
      "you are stirred up to venery.  I find in our faculty of medicine, and we\n",
      "have founded our opinion therein upon the deliberate resolution and final\n",
      "decision of the ancient Platonics, that carnal concupiscence is cooled and\n",
      "quelled five several ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, By the means of wine.  I shall easily believe that, quoth Friar\n",
      "John, for when I am well whittled with the juice of the grape I care for\n",
      "nothing else, so I may sleep.  When I say, quoth Rondibilis, that wine\n",
      "abateth lust, my meaning is, wine immoderately taken; for by intemperancy\n",
      "proceeding from the excessive drinking of strong liquor there is brought\n",
      "upon the body of such a swill-down boozer a chillness in the blood, a\n",
      "slackening in the sinews, a dissipation of the generative seed, a numbness\n",
      "and hebetation of the senses, with a perversive wryness and convulsion of\n",
      "the muscles--all which are great lets and impediments to the act of\n",
      "generation.  Hence it is that Bacchus, the god of bibbers, tipplers, and\n",
      "drunkards, is most commonly painted beardless and clad in a woman's habit,\n",
      "as a person altogether effeminate, or like a libbed eunuch.  Wine,\n",
      "nevertheless, taken moderately, worketh quite contrary effects, as is\n",
      "implied by the old proverb, which saith that Venus takes cold when not\n",
      "accompanied with Ceres and Bacchus.  This opinion is of great antiquity, as\n",
      "appeareth by the testimony of Diodorus the Sicilian, and confirmed by\n",
      "Pausanias, and universally held amongst the Lampsacians, that Don Priapus\n",
      "was the son of Bacchus and Venus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, The fervency of lust is abated by certain drugs, plants, herbs,\n",

      "to perform the act of generation; as hath been often experimented in the\n",

      "honeysuckle, tamarisk, chaste tree, mandrake, bennet, keckbugloss, the skin\n",
      "of a hippopotam, and many other such, which, by convenient doses\n",
      "proportioned to the peccant humour and constitution of the patient, being\n",
      "duly and seasonably received within the body--what by their elementary\n",
      "virtues on the one side and peculiar properties on the other--do either\n",
      "benumb, mortify, and beclumpse with cold the prolific semence, or scatter\n",
      "and disperse the spirits which ought to have gone along with and conducted\n",
      "the sperm to the places destined and appointed for its reception, or\n",
      "lastly, shut up, stop, and obstruct the ways, passages, and conduits\n",

      "We have nevertheless of those ingredients which, being of a contrary\n",
      "operation, heat the blood, bend the nerves, unite the spirits, quicken the\n",

      "called castrum, as if they would have said castum; because the soldiers,\n",

      "champions as are usually seen in a military circumvallation, do incessantly\n",

      "is to say, people moiling, stirring and hurrying up and down, restless, and\n",

      "Fourthly, The tickling pricks of incontinency are blunted by an eager\n",

      "yet alleged that she had both right and reason on her side for the killing\n",
      "of them.  Thus was the state of the question.  He found the business so\n",
      "dubious and intricate, that he knew not what to determine therein, nor\n",
      "which of the parties to incline to.  On the one hand, it was an execrable\n",
      "crime to cut off at once both her second husband and her son.  On the other\n",
      "hand, the cause of the murder seemed to be so natural, as to be grounded\n",
      "upon the law of nations and the rational instinct of all the people of the\n",
      "world, seeing they two together had feloniously and murderously destroyed\n",
      "her first son; not that they had been in any manner of way wronged,\n",
      "outraged, or injured by him, but out of an avaricious intent to possess his\n",
      "inheritance.  In this doubtful quandary and uncertainty what to pitch upon,\n",
      "he sent to the Areopagites then sitting at Athens to learn and obtain their\n",

      "of the dice, could not have erred nor awarded amiss on which side soever he\n",
      "had passed his casting and condemnatory sentence.  If against the woman,\n",
      "she deserved punishment for usurping sovereign authority by taking that\n",

      "of living among the Catchpoles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steering our course forwards the next day, we passed through Pettifogging,\n",
      "a country all blurred and blotted, so that I could hardly tell what to make\n",
      "on't.  There we saw some pettifoggers and catchpoles, rogues that will hang\n",
      "their father for a groat.  They neither invited us to eat or drink; but,\n",
      "with a multiplied train of scrapes and cringes, said they were all at our\n",
      "service for the Legem pone.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of our droggermen related to Pantagruel their strange way of living,\n",
      "diametrically opposed to that of our modern Romans; for at Rome a world of\n",
      "folks get an honest livelihood by poisoning, drubbing, lambasting,\n",
      "stabbing, and murthering; but the catchpoles earn theirs by being thrashed;\n",
      "so that if they were long without a tight lambasting, the poor dogs with\n",
      "their wives and children would be starved.  This is just, quoth Panurge,\n",
      "like those who, as Galen tells us, cannot erect the cavernous nerve towards\n",
      "the equinoctial circle unless they are soundly flogged.  By St. Patrick's\n",
      "slipper, whoever should jerk me so, would soon, instead of setting me\n",
      "right, throw me off the saddle, in the devil's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way is this, said the interpreter.  When a monk, levite, close-fisted\n",
      "usurer, or lawyer owes a grudge to some neighbouring gentleman, he sends to\n",
      "him one of those catchpoles or apparitors, who nabs, or at least cites him,\n",
      "serves a writ or warrant upon him, thumps, abuses, and affronts him\n",
      "impudently by natural instinct, and according to his pious instructions;\n",
      "insomuch, that if the gentleman hath but any guts in his brains, and is not\n",
      "more stupid than a gyrin frog, he will find himself obliged either to apply\n",
      "a faggot-stick or his sword to the rascal's jobbernowl, give him the gentle\n",
      "lash, or make him cut a caper out at the window, by way of correction.\n",
      "This done, Catchpole is rich for four months at least, as if bastinadoes\n",
      "were his real harvest; for the monk, levite, usurer, or lawyer will reward\n",
      "him roundly; and my gentleman must pay him such swingeing damages that his\n",
      "acres must bleed for it, and he be in danger of miserably rotting within a\n",
      "stone doublet, as if he had struck the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoth Panurge, I know an excellent remedy against this used by the Lord of\n",
      "Basche.  What is it? said Pantagruel.  The Lord of Basche, said Panurge,\n",
      "was a brave, honest, noble-spirited gentleman, who, at his return from the\n",
      "long war in which the Duke of Ferrara, with the help of the French, bravely\n",
      "defended himself against the fury of Pope Julius the Second, was every day\n",
      "cited, warned, and prosecuted at the suit and for the sport and fancy of\n",
      "the fat prior of St. Louant.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, as he was at breakfast with some of his domestics (for he\n",
      "loved to be sometimes among them) he sent for one Loire, his baker, and his\n",
      "spouse, and for one Oudart, the vicar of his parish, who was also his\n",
      "butler, as the custom was then in France; then said to them before his\n",
      "gentlemen and other servants:  You all see how I am daily plagued with\n",
      "these rascally catchpoles.  Truly, if you do not lend me your helping hand,\n",
      "I am finally resolved to leave the country, and go fight for the sultan, or\n",
      "the devil, rather than be thus eternally teased.  Therefore, to be rid of\n",
      "their damned visits, hereafter, when any of them come here, be ready, you\n",
      "baker and your wife, to make your personal appearance in my great hall, in\n",
      "your wedding clothes, as if you were going to be affianced.  Here, take\n",
      "these ducats, which I give you to keep you in a fitting garb.  As for you,\n",
      "Sir Oudart, be sure you make your personal appearance there in your fine\n",
      "surplice and stole, not forgetting your holy water, as if you were to wed\n",
      "them.  Be you there also, Trudon, said he to his drummer, with your pipe\n",
      "and tabor.  The form of matrimony must be read, and the bride kissed; then\n",
      "all of you, as the witnesses used to do in this country, shall give one\n",
      "another the remembrance of the wedding, which you know is to be a blow with\n",
      "your fist, bidding the party struck remember the nuptials by that token.\n",
      "This will but make you have the better stomach to your supper; but when you\n",
      "come to the catchpole's turn, thrash him thrice and threefold, as you would\n",
      "a sheaf of green corn; do not spare him; maul him, drub him, lambast him,\n",
      "swinge him off, I pray you.  Here, take these steel gauntlets, covered with\n",
      "kid.  Head, back, belly, and sides, give him blows innumerable; he that\n",
      "gives him most shall be my best friend.  Fear not to be called to an\n",
      "account about it; I will stand by you; for the blows must seem to be given\n",
      "in jest, as it is customary among us at all weddings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole? said the man of God.  All sorts of\n",
      "people daily resort to this castle.  I have taken care of that, replied the\n",
      "lord.  When some fellow, either on foot, or on a scurvy jade, with a large\n",
      "broad silver ring on his thumb, comes to the door, he is certainly a\n",
      "catchpole; the porter having civilly let him in, shall ring the bell; then\n",
      "be all ready, and come into the hall, to act the tragi-comedy whose plot I\n",
      "have now laid for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "That numerical day, as chance would have it, came an old fat ruddy\n",
      "catchpole.  Having knocked at the gate, and then pissed, as most men will\n",
      "do, the porter soon found him out, by his large greasy spatterdashes, his\n",
      "jaded hollow-flanked mare, his bagful of writs and informations dangling at\n",
      "his girdle, but, above all, by the large silver hoop on his left thumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "The porter was civil to him, admitted him in kindly, and rung the bell\n",
      "briskly. As soon as the baker and his wife heard it, they clapped on their\n",
      "best clothes, and made their personal appearance in the hall, keeping their\n",
      "gravities like a new-made judge.  The dominie put on his surplice and\n",
      "stole, and as he came out of his office, met the catchpole, had him in\n",
      "there, and made him suck his face a good while, while the gauntlets were\n",
      "drawing on all hands; and then told him, You are come just in pudding-time;\n",
      "my lord is in his right cue.  We shall feast like kings anon; here is to be\n",

      "the holy-water pot, followed by the catchpole, who, as he came into the\n",
      "hall, did not forget to make good store of awkward cringes, and then served\n",
      "Basche with a writ.  Basche gave him grimace for grimace, slipped an angel\n",
      "into his mutton-fist, and prayed him to assist at the contract and\n",
      "ceremony; which he did.  When it was ended, thumps and fisticuffs began to\n",
      "fly about among the assistants; but when it came to the catchpole's turn,\n",
      "they all laid on him so unmercifully with their gauntlets that they at last\n",
      "settled him, all stunned and battered, bruised and mortified, with one of\n",
      "his eyes black and blue, eight ribs bruised, his brisket sunk in, his\n",
      "omoplates in four quarters, his under jawbone in three pieces; and all this\n",
      "in jest, and no harm done.  God wot how the levite belaboured him, hiding\n",
      "within the long sleeve of his canonical shirt his huge steel gauntlet lined\n",
      "with ermine; for he was a strong-built ball, and an old dog at fisticuffs.\n",

      "home to L'Isle Bouchart, well pleased and edified, however, with Basche's\n",
      "kind reception; and, with the help of the good surgeons of the place, lived\n",
      "as long as you would have him.  From that time to this, not a word of the\n",

      "The catchpole being packed off on blind Sorrel--so he called his one-eyed\n",
      "mare--Basche sent for his lady, her women, and all his servants, into the\n",
      "arbour of his garden; had wine brought, attended with good store of\n",
      "pasties, hams, fruit, and other table-ammunition, for a nunchion; drank\n",
      "with them joyfully, and then told them this story:\n",
      "\n",
      "Master Francis Villon in his old age retired to St. Maxent in Poitou, under\n",
      "the patronage of a good honest abbot of the place.  There to make sport for\n",
      "the mob, he undertook to get the Passion acted, after the way, and in the\n",
      "dialect of the country.  The parts being distributed, the play having been\n",
      "rehearsed, and the stage prepared, he told the mayor and aldermen that the\n",
      "mystery might be ready after Niort fair, and that there only wanted\n",
      "properties and necessaries, but chiefly clothes fit for the parts; so the\n",
      "mayor and his brethren took care to get them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Villon, to dress an old clownish father greybeard, who was to represent God\n",
      "the father, begged of Friar Stephen Tickletoby, sacristan to the Franciscan\n",
      "friars of the place, to lend him a cope and a stole.  Tickletoby refused\n",
      "him, alleging that by their provincial statutes it was rigorously forbidden\n",
      "to give or lend anything to players.  Villon replied that the statute\n",
      "reached no farther than farces, drolls, antics, loose and dissolute games,\n",
      "and that he asked no more than what he had seen allowed at Brussels and\n",
      "other places.  Tickletoby notwithstanding peremptorily bid him provide\n",
      "himself elsewhere if he would, and not to hope for anything out of his\n",
      "monastical wardrobe.  Villon gave an account of this to the players, as of\n",
      "a most abominable action; adding, that God would shortly revenge himself,\n",
      "and make an example of Tickletoby.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Saturday following he had notice given him that Tickletoby, upon the\n",
      "filly of the convent--so they call a young mare that was never leaped yet\n",
      "--was gone a-mumping to St. Ligarius, and would be back about two in the\n",
      "afternoon.  Knowing this, he made a cavalcade of his devils of the Passion\n",
      "through the town.  They were all rigged with wolves', calves', and rams'\n",
      "skins, laced and trimmed with sheep's heads, bull's feathers, and large\n",
      "kitchen tenterhooks, girt with broad leathern girdles, whereat hanged\n",
      "dangling huge cow-bells and horse-bells, which made a horrid din.  Some\n",
      "held in their claws black sticks full of squibs and crackers; others had\n",
      "long lighted pieces of wood, upon which, at the corner of every street,\n",
      "they flung whole handfuls of rosin-dust, that made a terrible fire and\n",
      "smoke.  Having thus led them about, to the great diversion of the mob and\n",
      "the dreadful fear of little children, he finally carried them to an\n",
      "entertainment at a summer-house without the gate that leads to St.\n",
      "Ligarius.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they came near to the place, he espied Tickletoby afar off, coming home\n",
      "from mumping, and told them in macaronic verse:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hic est de patria, natus, de gente belistra,\n",

      "come to the place, they all rushed on a sudden into the road to meet him,\n",
      "and in a frightful manner threw fire from all sides upon him and his filly\n",
      "foal, ringing and tingling their bells, and howling like so many real\n",

      "hho, hho, hhoi.  Friar Stephen, don't we play the devils rarely?  The filly\n",
      "was soon scared out of her seven senses, and began to start, to funk it, to\n",
      "squirt it, to trot it, to fart it, to bound it, to gallop it, to kick it,\n",
      "to spurn it, to calcitrate it, to wince it, to frisk it, to leap it, to\n",

      "Tickletoby, though he held fast by the tree of the pack-saddle with might\n",
      "and main.  Now his straps and stirrups were of cord; and on the right side\n",
      "his sandals were so entangled and twisted that he could not for the heart's\n",
      "blood of him get out his foot.  Thus he was dragged about by the filly\n",
      "through the road, scratching his bare breech all the way; she still\n",
      "multiplying her kicks against him, and straying for fear over hedge and\n",
      "ditch, insomuch that she trepanned his thick skull so that his cockle\n",
      "brains were dashed out near the Osanna or high-cross.  Then his arms fell\n",
      "to pieces, one this way and the other that way; and even so were his legs\n",
      "served at the same time.  Then she made a bloody havoc with his puddings;\n",

      "playing at tennis; the Lord Basche at in-and-out with my lady; the\n",
      "waiting-men and gentle-women at push-pin; the officers at lanterloo, and the\n",
      "pages at hot-cockles, giving one another smart bangs.  They were all\n",

      "\n",
      "Upon this Oudart put on his sacerdotal, and Loire and his wife their\n",
      "nuptial badges; Trudon piped it, and then tabored it like mad; all made\n",
      "haste to get ready, not forgetting the gauntlets.  Basche went into the\n",
      "outward yard; there the catchpole meeting him fell on his marrow-bones,\n",
      "begged of him not to take it ill if he served him with a writ at the suit\n",
      "of the fat prior; and in a pathetic speech let him know that he was a\n",
      "public person, a servant to the monking tribe, apparitor to the abbatial\n",
      "mitre, ready to do as much for him, nay, for the least of his servants,\n",
      "whensoever he would employ and use him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, truly, said the lord, you shall not serve your writ till you have\n",
      "tasted some of my good Quinquenays wine, and been a witness to a wedding\n",
      "which we are to have this very minute.  Let him drink and refresh himself,\n",
      "added he, turning towards the levitical butler, and then bring him into the\n",
      "hall.  After which, Catchpole, well stuffed and moistened, came with Oudart\n",
      "to the place where all the actors in the farce stood ready to begin.  The\n",
      "sight of their game set them a-laughing, and the messenger of mischief\n",
      "grinned also for company's sake.  Then the mysterious words were muttered\n",
      "to and by the couple, their hands joined, the bride bussed, and all\n",
      "besprinkled with holy water.  While they were bringing wine and kickshaws,\n",
      "thumps began to trot about by dozens.  The catchpole gave the levite\n",
      "several blows.  Oudart, who had his gauntlet hid under his canonical shirt,\n",
      "draws it on like a mitten, and then, with his clenched fist, souse he fell\n",
      "on the catchpole and mauled him like a devil; the junior gauntlets dropped\n",
      "on him likewise like so many battering rams.  Remember the wedding by this,\n",
      "by that, by these blows, said they.  In short, they stroked him so to the\n",
      "purpose that he pissed blood out at mouth, nose, ears, and eyes, and was\n",
      "bruised, thwacked, battered, bebumped, and crippled at the back, neck,\n",
      "breast, arms, and so forth.  Never did the bachelors at Avignon in carnival\n",
      "time play more melodiously at raphe than was then played on the catchpole's\n",
      "microcosm.  At last down he fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "They threw a great deal of wine on his snout, tied round the sleeve of his\n",
      "doublet a fine yellow and green favour, and got him upon his snotty beast,\n",
      "and God knows how he got to L'Isle Bouchart; where I cannot truly tell you\n",
      "whether he was dressed and looked after or no, both by his spouse and the\n",
      "able doctors of the country; for the thing never came to my ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day they had a third part to the same tune, because it did not\n",
      "appear by the lean catchpole's bag that he had served his writ.  So the fat\n",
      "prior sent a new catchpole, at the head of a brace of bums for his garde du\n",
      "corps, to summon my lord.  The porter ringing the bell, the whole family\n",
      "was overjoyed, knowing that it was another rogue.  Basche was at dinner\n",
      "with his lady and the gentlemen; so he sent for the catchpole, made him sit\n",
      "by him, and the bums by the women, and made them eat till their bellies\n",
      "cracked with their breeches unbuttoned.  The fruit being served, the\n",
      "catchpole arose from table, and before the bums cited Basche.  Basche\n",
      "kindly asked him for a copy of the warrant, which the other had got ready;\n",
      "he then takes witness and a copy of the summons.  To the catchpole and his\n",
      "bums he ordered four ducats for civility money.  In the meantime all were\n",
      "withdrawn for the farce.  So Trudon gave the alarm with his tabor.  Basche\n",
      "desired the catchpole to stay and see one of his servants married, and\n",
      "witness the contract of marriage, paying him his fee.  The catchpole\n",
      "slapdash was ready, took out his inkhorn, got paper immediately, and his\n",

      "\n",
      "Then Loire came into the hall at one door, and his wife with the\n",

      "giveth them the matrimonial blessing, and was very liberal of holy water.\n",
      "The contract written, signed, and registered, on one side was brought wine\n",

      "precious stones, as rubies, emeralds, (diamonds,) and pearls, more, or at\n",

      "pretty long stick, and made us all kiss the part of the stick that had\n",
      "touched the image.  After this he said unto us, What think you of this\n",
      "image?  It is the likeness of a pope, answered Pantagruel; I know it by the\n",
      "triple crown, his furred amice, his rochet, and his slipper.  You are in\n",

      "Thus, said Friar John, at Seuille, the rascally beggars being one evening\n",
      "on a solemn holiday at supper in the spital, one bragged of having got six\n",
      "blancs, or twopence halfpenny; another eight liards, or twopence; a third,\n",
      "seven caroluses, or sixpence; but an old mumper made his vaunts of having\n",
      "got three testons, or five shillings.  Ah, but, cried his comrades, thou\n",
      "hast a leg of God; as if, continued Friar John, some divine virtue could\n",

      "could to be queens.  One of them was within a step of the coronation place,\n",
      "but there the golden knight lay ready to intercept her, so that she could\n",
      "go no further.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new golden queen, resolved to show herself valiant and worthy of her\n",
      "advancement to the crown, achieved great feats of arms.  But in the\n",
      "meantime the silvered knight takes the golden warden who guarded the camp;\n",
      "and thus there was a new silvered queen, who, like the other, strove to\n",
      "excel in heroic deeds at the beginning of her reign.  Thus the fight grew\n",
      "hotter than before.  A thousand stratagems, charges, rallyings, retreats,\n",
      "and attacks were tried on both sides; till at last the silvered queen,\n",
      "having by stealth advanced as far as the golden king's tent, cried, God\n",
      "save you, sir!  Now none but his new queen could relieve him; so she\n",
      "bravely came and exposed herself to the utmost extremity to deliver him out\n",
      "of it.  Then the silvered warden with his queen reduced the golden king to\n",
      "such a stress that, to save himself, he was forced to lose his queen; but\n",
      "the golden king took him at last.  However, the rest of the golden party\n",
      "were soon taken; and that king being left alone, the silvered party made\n",
      "him a low bow, crying, Good morrow, sir! which denoted that the silvered\n",
      "king had got the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "This being heard, the music of both parties loudly proclaimed the victory.\n",
      "And thus the first battle ended to the unspeakable joy of all the\n",
      "spectators.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this the two brigades took their former stations, and began to tilt a\n",
      "second time, much as they had done before, only the music played somewhat\n",
      "faster than at the first battle, and the motions were altogether different.\n",
      "I saw the golden queen sally out one of the first, with an archer and a\n",
      "knight, as it were angry at the former defeat, and she had like to have\n",
      "fallen upon the silvered king in his tent among his officers; but having\n",
      "been baulked in her attempt, she skirmished briskly, and overthrew so many\n",
      "silvered nymphs and officers that it was a most amazing sight.  You would\n",
      "have sworn she had been another Penthesilea; for she behaved herself with\n",
      "as much bravery as that Amazonian queen did at Troy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this havoc did not last long; for the silvered party, exasperated by\n",
      "their loss, resolved to perish or stop her progress; and having posted an\n",
      "archer in ambuscado on a distant angle, together with a knight-errant, her\n",
      "highness fell into their hands and was carried out of the field.  The rest\n",
      "were soon routed after the taking of their queen, who, without doubt, from\n",
      "that time resolved to be more wary and keep near her king, without\n",
      "venturing so far amidst her enemies unless with more force to defend her.\n",
      "Thus the silvered brigade once more got the victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "This did not dishearten or deject the golden party; far from it.  They soon\n",
      "appeared again in the field to face their enemies; and being posted as\n",
      "before, both the armies seemed more resolute and cheerful than ever.  Now\n",
      "the martial concert began, and the music was above a hemiole the quicker,\n",
      "according to the warlike Phrygian mode, such as was invented by Marsyas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then our combatants began to wheel about, and charge with such a swiftness\n",
      "that in an instant they made four moves, besides the usual salutations.  So\n",
      "that they were continually in action, flying, hovering, jumping, vaulting,\n",
      "curvetting, with petauristical turns and motions, and often intermingled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing them then turn about on one foot after they had made their honours,\n",
      "we compared them to your tops or gigs, such as boys use to whip about,\n",
      "making them turn round so swiftly that they sleep, as they call it, and\n",
      "motion cannot be perceived, but resembles rest, its contrary; so that if\n",
      "you make a point or mark on some part of one of those gigs, 'twill be\n",
      "perceived not as a point, but a continual line, in a most divine manner, as\n",
      "Cusanus has wisely observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were thus warmly engaged, we heard continually the claps and\n",
      "episemapsies which those of the two bands reiterated at the taking of their\n",
      "enemies; and this, joined to the variety of their motions and music, would\n",
      "have forced smiles out of the most severe Cato, the never-laughing Crassus,\n",
      "the Athenian man-hater, Timon; nay, even whining Heraclitus, though he\n",
      "abhorred laughing, the action that is most peculiar to man.  For who could\n",
      "have forborne? seeing those young warriors, with their nymphs and queens,\n",
      "so briskly and gracefully advance, retire, jump, leap, skip, spring, fly,\n",
      "vault, caper, move to the right, to the left, every way still in time, so\n",

      "As the number of the combatants lessened, the pleasure of the spectators\n",
      "increased; for the stratagems and motions of the remaining forces were more\n",
      "singular.  I shall only add that this pleasing entertainment charmed us to\n",
      "such a degree that our minds were ravished with admiration and delight, and\n",
      "the martial harmony moved our souls so powerfully that we easily believed\n",
      "what is said of Ismenias's having excited Alexander to rise from table and\n",
      "run to his arms, with such a warlike melody.  At last the golden king\n",
      "remained master of the field; and while we were minding those dances, Queen\n",

      "these holy friars had usually quilted bellies, and thick quilted paunches\n",
      "were among them in much repute.  Their codpieces were cut slipper-fashion,\n",
      "and every monk among them wore two--one sewed before and another behind\n",
      "--reporting that some certain dreadful mysteries were duly represented by\n",
      "this duplicity of codpieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "They wore shoes as round as basins, in imitation of those who inhabit the\n",

      "show they did not value fortune, Benius made them shave and poll the hind\n",
      "part of their polls as bare as a bird's arse, from the crown to the\n",
      "shoulder-blades; but they had leave to let their hair grow before, from the\n",
      "two triangular bones in the upper part of the skull.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus did they not value fortune a button, and cared no more for the goods\n",
      "of this world than you or I do for hanging.  And to show how much they\n",
      "defied that blind jilt, all of them wore, not in their hands like her, but\n",

      "laugh at barefaced trulls when they have those mufflers on which they call\n",

      "well 'twas tuned to the sound of their bells!  You'll never find these to\n",

      "May I be gutted like an oyster if I can tell what to make on't.  Then the\n",
      "more 'tis to be feared, said Pantagruel; for subtlety suspected, subtlety\n",
      "foreseen, subtlety found out, loses the essence and very name of subtlety,\n",
      "and only gains that of blockishness.  They are not such fools as you take\n",

      "treated them after a fashion.  They began their meal as you end yours, with\n",
      "cheese, and ended it with mustard and lettuce, as Martial tells us the\n",
      "ancients did.  Afterwards a platterful of mustard was brought before every\n",

      "of the Temple of Fortune at Praeneste in Sylla's time, or the pavement of\n",

      "and they were ordered in such a manner that you would have thought some\n",
      "vine-leaves and branches had been carelessly strewed on the pavement; for\n",
      "in some places they were thick, and thin in others.  That inlaying was very\n",
      "wonderful everywhere.  Here were seen, as it were in the shade, some snails\n",
      "crawling on the grapes; there, little lizards running on the branches.  On\n",

      "At the beginning, divers towns, hamlets, castles, fortresses, and forests\n",
      "were seen in flames; and several mad and loose women, who furiously ripped\n",
      "up and tore live calves, sheep, and lambs limb from limb, and devoured\n",
      "their flesh.  There we learned how Bacchus, at his coming into India,\n",
      "destroyed all things with fire and sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding this, he was so despised by the Indians that they did not\n",
      "think it worth their while to stop his progress, having been certainly\n",
      "informed by their spies that his camp was destitute of warriors, and that\n",
      "he had only with him a crew of drunken females, a low-built, old,\n",
      "effeminate, sottish fellow, continually addled, and as drunk as a\n",
      "wheelbarrow, with a pack of young clownish doddipolls, stark naked, always\n",
      "skipping and frisking up and down, with tails and horns like those of young\n",
      "kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this reason the Indians had resolved to let them go through their\n",
      "country without the least opposition, esteeming a victory over such enemies\n",
      "more dishonourable than glorious.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime Bacchus marched on, burning everything; for, as you know,\n",
      "fire and thunder are his paternal arms, Jupiter having saluted his mother\n",
      "Semele with his thunder, so that his maternal house was ruined by fire.\n",
      "Bacchus also caused a great deal of blood to be spilt; which, when he is\n",
      "roused and angered, principally in war, is as natural to him as to make\n",
      "some in time of peace.\n",

      "Thus the plains of the island of Samos are called Panema, which signifies\n",
      "bloody, because Bacchus there overtook the Amazons, who fled from the\n",
      "country of Ephesus, and there let 'em blood, so that they all died of\n",
      "phlebotomy.  This may give you a better insight into the meaning of an\n",
      "ancient proverb than Aristotle has done in his problems, viz., Why 'twas\n",
      "formerly said, Neither eat nor sow any mint in time of war.  The reason is,\n",
      "that blows are given then without any distinction of parts or persons, and\n",
      "if a man that's wounded has that day handled or eaten any mint, 'tis\n",
      "impossible, or at least very hard, to stanch his blood.\n",

      "with stag's or goat's skins, and armed with torches, javelins, spears, and\n",

      "for its scarcity, which you know raises the price of everything, and\n",
      "principally of those leaves in India.  In this Alexander the Great followed\n",
      "his example at his Indian triumph.  The chariot was drawn by elephants\n",
      "joined together, wherein he was imitated by Pompey the Great at Rome in his\n",

      "In the middle of the roof was fixed a ring of massive gold, as thick as my\n",

      "about two feet and a half below it, and in a triangle supported a round\n",
      "plate of fine gold whose diameter or breadth did not exceed two cubits and\n",
      "half a span.  There were four holes in it, in each of which an empty ball\n",
      "was fastened, hollow within, and open o' top, like a little lamp; its\n",
      "circumference about two hands' breadth.  Each ball was of precious stone;\n",
      "one an amethyst, another an African carbuncle, the third an opal, and the\n",
      "fourth an anthracites.  They were full of burning water five times\n",
      "distilled in a serpentine limbec, and inconsumptible, like the oil formerly\n",
      "put into Pallas' golden lamp at Acropolis of Athens by Callimachus.  In\n",
      "each of them was a flaming wick, partly of asbestine flax, as of old in the\n",
      "temple of Jupiter Ammon, such as those which Cleombrotus, a most studious\n",

      "fastened to three handles that were fixed to a large round lamp of most\n",
      "pure crystal, whose diameter was a cubit and a half, and opened about two\n",
      "hands' breadths o' top; by which open place a vessel of the same crystal,\n",
      "shaped somewhat like the lower part of a gourd-like limbec, or an urinal,\n",
      "was put at the bottom of the great lamp, with such a quantity of the\n",
      "afore-mentioned burning water, that the flame of the asbestine wick reached\n",
      "the centre of the great lamp.  This made all its spherical body seem to burn\n",
      "and be in a flame, because the fire was just at the centre and middle point,\n",
      "so that it was not more easy to fix the eye on it than on the disc of the\n",
      "sun, the matter being wonderfully bright and shining, and the work most\n",
      "transparent and dazzling by the reflection of the various colours of the\n",
      "precious stones whereof the four small lamps above the main lamp were made,\n",

      "proportion and action.  Neither did this seem engraved, but rather hewed\n",
      "out and embossed in relief, or at least like grotesque, which, by the\n",
